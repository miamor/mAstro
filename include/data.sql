(1453, 0, 'vn', 'love-f-sagittarius-m-sagittarius', 4, 'Nếu em Cung Thủ có muốn phàn nàn gì về anh người yêu hay anh chồng Ma Kết về tính tình của ảnh, em nên uốn lưỡn 7 lần mà kiềm hãm cái sự thẳng thừng toạc móng heo của mình lại. Em có thể cứu rỗi được cảm xúc của ảnh &#8211; và mối quan hệ của hai người – bằng cách học một cuốn từ điển và sử dụng bộ não của mình. Trái tim em sẽ không phải đổ nhiều mồ hôi nước mắt nếu em chơi trò từ-đồng-nghĩa mỗi khi tức giận. Cho em xem thử một ví dụ nhé. Một cách khác để nói “ích kỉ” là gì? “Tự thỏa mãn” (Nguyên gốc: “self-indulgent”). Còn cách nào khác để nói “lạnh lùng” và “nhẫn tâm” không? Hãy thử “lí trí, nhưng thiếu nhạy cảm”. “Kẹt xỉ” là một từ nặng nề đấy. “Tiết kiệm” và “tằn tiện” nhẹ nhàng hơn nhiều. Và thay vì dùng “bảo thủ”, hãy thử dùng “cần trọng và đứng đắn”. Em cứ thử như vậy xem.<br/>Nếu em hét vào mặt Tiểu Dê rằng: “Anh là đồ ích kỉ! Lạnh lùng, vô lương tâm. Thêm nữa là đồ kẹt xỉ và bảo thủ cổ lỗ sĩ” – em sẽ mất anh (đồng thời mất luôn cơ hội trưởng thành hơn dưới sự hướng dẫn chắc chắn và kiên nhẫn của anh). Câu từ sẽ nhẹ nhàng hơn, ít thẳng thừng và nanh nọc hơn, nếu em đơn giản nói trong bình tĩnh: “Đôi lúc, anh chỉ biết thỏa mãn bản thân thôi. Mà có khi anh còn quá thực tế, tiết kiệm và cẩn trọng nữa. Anh có nhận thấy điều đó không?” (Mặc dù em đang chửi thầm anh trong đầu là đồ quái thú keo kiệt, ích kỉ, nhẫn tâm). Khi em thể hiện những lời phàn nàn của mình thế này, anh có thể sẽ ghi chú lại trong đầu rằng anh nên mài mòn bớt những cạnh sắc bén của mình và thậm chí anh có thể mỉm cười. Đúng rồi đấy, anh sẽ mỉm cười.<br/>Thật bất ngờ khi con người ta cảm thấy dễ chịu khi được nghe những miêu tả về những phẩm chất mơ hồ của cung Hoàng Đạo của mình (nếu không dùng những từ ngữ nặng nề), thậm chí ngay cả khi những phẩm chất đó bị người khác cho là tiêu cực. Nói với một đứa Kim Ngưu rằng mày thiệt là bốc đồng, nó sẽ cau mày. Nhưng từ “bốc đồng” đó sẽ khiến Bạch Dương vui vẻ. Nói với một thằng Sư Tử rằng nó kiêu hãnh quá đi, ẻm sẽ tỏa sáng chói lọi. Cũng với từ đó, Xử Nữ sẽ thấy bị xúc phạm. Bảo Song Tử hay thay đổi, nó sẽ cười tán thành. Thử nói từ đó với một Thần Nông xem, chả ăn ngay một cú chích bò cạp bất mãn ấy chứ. Thần Nông hay thay đổi á hả? Không đời nào. Kêu một đứa Cự Giải là bảo thủ, nó sẽ coi đó là lời khen có bản chất thận trọng của nó – nhưng nếu nói với một em Nhân Mã rằng ẻm bảo thủ, ẻm sẽ kêu bạn đi ăn c** đi (Nguyệt: thứ nhất, đã dịch đúng phần “c**”. Thứ hai, lạy mợ, mình là Nhân Mã có máu Cự Giải trong người). Và cứ như vậy, một tính xấu của người này trong mắt người nọ, nhìn theo cách của họ, lại là một phẩm chất tốt. Cái chuyện này tốt đấy chứ, nếu không thì chúng ta chẳng thể nào sống chung với nhau được, đúng không? Đúng! (Bạch Dương luôn đúng, chả sai bao giờ. Bạn cho đó là tự phụ? Tôi là một Bạch Dương và tôi nghĩ đó là một phẩm chất tuyệt vời! Nếu bạn nghĩ cái tính đó chẳng tốt đẹp gì, thì là bạn đang ghen tị với Bạch Dương bọn tôi thôi) (Nguyệt: con lạy mợ Linda).<br/>Chẳng có gì ngạc nhiên nếu một anh trai Ma Kết có vẻ lạnh lùng, đó là bởi vì anh luôn sợ phải để cho cảm xúc mình trưng ra ngoài quá lộ liễu, vì anh sợ chúng sẽ bị chà đạp (và một em Nhân Mã thì hoàn toàn có thể đạp ầm ầm lên tim người khác mà đi lắm). Nhưng anh không hoàn toàn ích kỉ. Đúng thật là anh có thể quan tâm bản thân mình trước nhất, nhưng liên tục nói rằng anh ích kỉ chỉ tổ khiến anh dần dần sống đúng với cái hình ảnh “ích kỉ”đó mà thôi. Người bạn yêu sẽ dần dần phát triển thành hình ảnh mà bạn luôn nghĩ về họ trong đầu và trong tim, bạn có biết điều đó? Thật đấy. Đó là một luật lệ chẳng tổn hại gì đến tinh thần – thể xác đối với sự trao đổi cảm xúc con người trong phạm vi đầy sức mạnh của tình yêu.<br/>Nói đến tình yêu là nói đến tình dục, vì hai vấn đề này không thể tách rời trong sự thành công của một mối quan hệ cảm xúc giữa một người đàn ông và một người phụ nữ. Chỉ có tình dục thôi sẽ dẫn đến tâm bệnh và sự trống trải chết chóc trong tâm hồn. Chỉ có tình yêu mà không có tình dục sẽ dẫn đến cảm giác chưa thỏa mãn và sự cô đơn – vì tình yêu và tình dục là một cặp song sinh. Sự hòa hợp tình dục của cặp đôi 2 -12 Đất – Lửa này sẽ tốt hoặc xấu phụ thuộc vào cách họ chấp nhận những mặt khác trong tính cách của đối phương. Ban đầu, có một sự cưỡng ép họ phải chạm vào nhau, đó là một cảm giác tò mò mãnh liệt với đối phương và điều này đã làm tăng thêm sức hút giữa họ. Anh ấy thiệt là khác biệt, ảnh sẽ là một người tình như thế nào? (Ý em là “khác” so với em). Cô ấy thiệt là khác biệt, nếu hoàn toàn sở hữu được em thì sẽ như thế nào nhỉ? (Ý anh là “khác” so với anh).<br/>Không thể chối cãi được rằng cái sự tò mò cường liệt như vậy sẽ tạo ra một sức hút thể xác giữa hai người. Chỉ là sau đó, khi tình yêu của họ đã vượt qua một ngưỡng mới và bước vào cánh cửa của tình dục, thì phương diện thể xác sẽ bắt đầu mất dần sức hấp dẫn của nó. Sự tò mò đã được thỏa mãn sẽ làm giảm đi sự kì vọng. Nhưng chỉ cần anh tưởng tượng thêm một chút … em kiên nhẫn thêm một chút … họ sẽ học được rằng tình dục không nhất thiết sẽ gây ra nhàm chán lẫn nhau. Tình dục có thể đem lại một cảm xúc ấm áp hiếm có và những đam mê sâu thẳm mà sự tò mò với cái mới lạ không thể đem đến. Tiểu Dê cần chống lại sự vụng về của mình khi làm tình xong rồi nhanh chóng ngủ luôn – hoặc khi cho rằng thỏa mãn tình dục không cần đến vuốt ve yêu chiều. Tiểu Mã nên cẩn trọng với xu hướng thẳng thừng của mình, như kiểu đâm anh bằng một mũi tên sự thật ngay khi anh đang chuẩn bị vươn tay ra ôm lấy em. Và rồi em sẽ phàn nàn rằng anh “lạnh lùng”, trong khi em mới là người đã dìm những ham muốn dục vọng của anh xuống hầm nước đá.<br/>Hai hành tinh quản chiếu của họ lí giải tất cả. Hành tinh của Ma Kết là Thổ Tinh, và Thổ Tinh có xu hướng hạn chế quá đáng. Hành tinh của Nhân Mã là Mộc Tinh, và Mộc Tinh có xu hướng mở rộng và áp đảo. Khi Thổ Tinh và Mộc Tinh hòa hợp xung động, hai hành tinh có thể gây ra động đất (nghĩa đen, theo chiêm tinh học). Mỗi hành tinh sở hữu sức mạnh riêng và chẳng đứa nào hòa nhã ôn nhu cả. Dựa vào gợi ý về hành tinh này thì anh nên cố gắng uốn nắn bản chất rực lửa bốc đồng của em thành một thứ đam mê thỏa mãn hơn và sâu lắng hơn, cẩn thận đừng làm khao khát của em bị đóng băng đấy. Còn em nên nhận ra anh đau đớn thế nào khi ngóng chờ một ai đó có thể giải thoát anh khỏi cái ngục tù mang tên cẩn trọng” của sao Thổ … một người như em … giải thoát cho cảm xúc của anh, để anh có thể bỏ mặc cái gọi là cẩn trọng đó và thưởng thức niềm đam mê sâu thẳm bên trong của mình.<br/>Ma Kết là người đàn ông thích nằm ở nhà trên đỉnh núi cáo một mình (hoặc với em) còn hơn là bước đi trên đại lộ đông đúc ồn ào của Cuộc Đời. Anh luôn yêu cầu sự nổi tiếng và thành công ở một mức độ nào đó. (Miễn là anh không phải ngồi kí tặng fan. Anh ghét việc này). Trong trường hợp anh không đạt được như vậy, anh cần người phụ nữ của anh có một sự nhận thức tôn trọng nhất định với những thành tựu công khai và bí mật của mình. Đây là một nhu cầu sống còn và không được để nó bị đè nén quá mức. Anh ngưỡng mộ và ghen tị với những người nổi tiếng, những người thành công và vì vậy anh sẽ cảm thấy thất bại nếu anh không thể trèo lên đỉnh của ít nhất một ngọn đồi nhỏ. Không nhất thiết phải là đỉnh Pikes Peak đâu. Chìa khóa chính của những tâm trạng của anh chính là sự thất vọng đối với bản thân – khoảng cách giữa những thành quả mà anh đã đạt được với mục tiêu mà anh đã đề ra trong bí mật.<br/>Em gái Nhân Mã không chia sẻ với anh nhu cầu được leo lên đỉnh núi đầy âm thầm mà tuyệt vọng ấy, nhưng em cần biết rằng những mũi tên hy vọng sáng lấp lánh được em nhắm bắn từ cánh cung Jupiter của niềm tin và lí tưởng thỉnh thoảng mới trúng mục tiêu. Trái tim luôn tìm kiếm của em cần một điểm hồng tâm, bằng không tinh thần rực lửa của em sẽ biến mất. Một Tiểu Mã không còn lửa và linh hồn sẽ là gì chứ? Một nàng hề buồn bã. Không gì buồn hơn một nàng hề với lớp mặt nạ dũng cảm tươi sáng đã bị nhòe đi bởi những giọt nước mắt.<br/>Khi anh cục cằn vì thành công vẫn nấp sau màn sương … khi em buồn bã vì những giấc mơ của em sao mà đến thật chậm và chẳng chịu thành sự thật … Ma Kết và Nhân Mã nên cùng nhau bắt một chuyến bay nào đó đến một nơi xa xăm, nơi ma thuật ẩn hiện trong không khí. Đôi khi một chuyến đi cùng nhau sẽ lại một lần nữa đem đến những ngôi sao may mắn cho chàng Dê và nàng Ngựa, hai con người từ lâu lắm rồi đã không còn hôn nhau chúc ngủ ngon.<br/><b>Hết.</b><br/>Nữ Ma Kết chính là một sinh vật giống cái quyến rũ, luôn biết chính xác nó muốn cái gì trong đời và và làm thế nào để có được điều đó. Cung Thủ cảm nhận được những mục tiêu của cô nàng là không hề nhỏ, nhưng cũng có thể vĩ đại như chính những mục tiêu của anh ta, và điều đó làm anh ta thấy sợ. Nàng yên tĩnh và khiêm tốn, không chen ngang anh khi anh ấy đang nói về những ý tưởng và giấc mơ, và điều đó khiến nàng trở thành một tiểu thư thật-sự-đặc-biệt. Đối với anh nàng là một người con gái dịu dàng, ngoan ngoãn, con gái ra con gái. Nữ tính và cuốn hút.<br/>Anh ta đã mắc một sai lầm to. Nàng có thể được sinh ra dưới một Cung hoàng đạo nữ tính, nhưng nàng được chiếu mệnh bởi sao Thổ và không hành tinh nào nam tính bằng sao Thổ. Mặc dù nàng có thể có những hành động dịu dàng, nàng không hề ngoan ngoãn. Cuốn hút, ừ có thể, nhưng anh đừng tưởng tượng ra cái cảnh nàng cầm dù mặc váy phồng nhón gót tha thẩn dưới cây táo trong vườn, giả vờ làm rơi cái khăn tay đượm nước hoa để trêu anh. Cô nàng này không dễ xơi đâu.<br/>Trên tất cả, nàng là một con dê núi, đó là chưa kể đến giới tính. Nàng sẽ ăn mọi thứ trên đường để biết nàng đang đi đâu (ý là con dê nó ăn hết mấy thứ cản đường để thấy đường mà đi đó), trừ một loại đồ ăn nàng không thích đến từ cái can mang tên “Sự ngốc nghếch”. Đối với Ma Kết, “ngốc nghếch” được định nghĩa là tất cả những thứ làm tốn thời gian của nàng và không có mục đích vững chắc. Điều đó chắc chắn bao gồm tán tỉnh lằng nhằng mãi chẳng được và các mối quan hệ tạm thời. Chú ý rằng tôi không nói là cô ấy không thích tán tỉnh, cô ấy chỉ không thích tán tỉnh lằng nhằng không tác dụng gì. Tôi cũng không nói cô ấy không thích các mối quan hệ, chỉ là không thích các mối quan hệ tạm thời. Sự khác biệt kiểu gì cũng sẽ được chứng minh là khá quan trọng. Vấn đề là, nữ Ma Kết muốn biết các ý định của bạn trước cả khi bạn có bất cứ ý định nào. Hay như tôi nói lúc trước, nam Nhân Mã phải suy nghĩ kĩ về những ý định đối với nữ Ma Kết. Các anh tốt nhất đừng có thể hiện là loại người mà các anh thể hiện với hầu hết phụ nữ khác, không thì các anh nên quên phi vụ này đi. Nam Nhân Mã thông thường là những người lăng nhăng một cách lãng mạn hơn là là loại người-đàn-ông-chung-thủy-nhất-thế-giới, ít nhất không phải là trong lúc anh ta đang tìm kiếm và nghiên cứu quang cảnh. Sau khi tìm thấy Tiểu thư Guinevere, cô hầu gái Marian hay bất cứ ai, chàng hiệp sĩ của sao Mộc (người tự cho mình là Robinhood lẫn Lancelot) sẽ có khả năng trở nên trung thành và dâng hiến rất thuần Camelot. Nhưng trong khi anh chàng cưỡi bạch mã lượn khắp Sherwood, bộ áo giáp bóng lộn có thể bị lu mờ một chút. Và dĩ nhiên, tình yêu – tình yêu đích thực ấy – sẽ đánh bóng nó trở lại ngay lập tức.<br/>Áo giáp bị mờ không ngăn cản được nữ Ma Kết. Cô nàng thực tế trong chuyện tình yêu và trong mọi thứ khác. Áo giáp bị mờ thì có thể đánh bóng lại, như mới. Chả ai nhận ra sự khác biệt. Một chút dơ chẳng có gì để phải xoắn, nếu nó có thể chùi được. Ngày hôm qua qua rồi, hôm nay mới là hiện tại. Chỉ cần nhớ coi chừng ngày mai. Nàng có thể bỏ qua cho cho chàng Cung Thủ của mình những lần phá luật trong quá khứ và nàng đủ lý trí và chắc chắn trong tình cảm để tin tưởng anh ấy trong hôm nay – nhưng nàng không đời nào chịu đựng được cái kiểu làm ăn cà giựt trong tương lai, hoặc không thì anh sẽ bị đá vào quá khứ mà nàng không chớp mắt lấy một cái, và anh sẽ cùng vui chơi với số ít lỗi lầm nàng mắc phải trong cả cuộc đời từ đây (và các lỗi lầm của nàng có thể đếm trên đầu ngón tay, nếu nàng là một Ma Kết cẩn thận).<br/>Sự cứng rắn của nữ Ma Kết không làm nam Nhân Mã ngay lập tức chùn bước. Nên nhớ Nhân Mã được sinh ra dưới một cung hoàng đạo nam tính và được chiếu mệnh bởi sao Mộc cũng nam tính. Nam tính gấp đôi. Vì vậy anh chàng sẽ không chạy trốn thử thách của nữ Ma Kết. Cô nàng này không phải để dành cho những kẻ yếu tim chinh phục và Nhân Mã không phải là loại yếu tim. Anh chàng chỉ hơi kì quặc trong lĩnh vực khéo léo hay mưu mẹo. Nam Nhân Mã có thể phun ra mấy lời quan sát vô tư mà không hề suy nghĩ kĩ, làm tổn thương nhân phẩm của nàng (các nàng Dê luôn coi trọng hóa nhân phẩm, đặc biệt là ở chốn công cộng). Không phải là nàng không coi trọng mấy cái quan sát đó, nàng cũng có tính vui vẻ và hay thay đổi, nhưng nàng sẽ nhíu mày trước những câu chuyện hài ko lời kết cụt ngủn, những hành vi thô lỗ sẽ làm nàng tắt ngóm – và nàng sẽ không muốn nghe mấy cái lỗi của nàng được vô tư phân tích đánh giá trước mặt đám đông, mà điều đó lại là một tài năng của Nhân Mã (gọi nó là tài năng thì hơi bị tốt bụng).<br/>Tuy nhiên, nàng vẫn trân trọng sự trung thực của anh. Ngược lại, anh cũng sẽ ngưỡng mộ nàng. Ở khoản này họ hợp nhau nổi tiếng luôn. Nàng lí trí và thực tế, không bao giờ tô hồng mọi thứ &#8211; chàng luôn nói thật, không che dấu sự thật bằng những ngôn từ hoa mỹ. Cách tiếp cận trực tiếp có sức hút đối với họ và điều này đủ chất lượng để trở thành một nền tảng khá mạnh cho sự đồng cảm giữa hai người, dù điều này sẽ hơi khó khăn đối với bạn bè của họ. Nếu bạn đến chơi nhà của cặp đôi này, và họ phải đi làm hay ra sân bay sớm hay đại loại thế, bạn chắc chắn sẽ được nhắc nhở về chuyện trễ rồi bằng phong cách quýt xờ tộc dễ thương của Ma Kết và sự phóng khoáng thẳng thắn và thân thiện của Nhân Mã. Nhưng kiểu gì thì bạn cũng sẽ bị nhắc. Bạn sẽ biết là bạn đã lố giờ thăm hỏi rồi. Thực ra họ sẽ không khiến bạn cảm thấy không về khoông được, nhưng chắc chắn bạn sẽ nhận ra thông điệp.<br/>Cặp đôi này có thể có những điểm chung trong âm nhạc hay nghệ thuật, luật pháp hay tôn giáo, và anh ấy cảm thấy ấn tượng bởi cách nàng sẽ hy sinh mọi thứ cho khao khát của trái tim. Anh đã đúng. Nếu như nàng đang sống ở một thị trấn nhỏ và đang theo học một trường mà nàng không thể học các môn học nghệ thuật mà nàng muốn, nàng sẽ nhận công việc ở một trạm xăng, đổ xăng, lau cửa sổ xe, để dành tiền để đến New York nơi họ sẽ dạy nàng những thứ nàng muốn học. Dù vậy, nữ Ma Kết vẫn sắp xếp để ở với gia đình trong lúc còn đi học – và rồi sẽ miễn cường rời khỏi nhà để tự giang cánh bay. Cung Thủ có thể hiểu sự cống hiến dữ dội để đạt được mục tiêu của nàng. Anh ấy cũng tự ám ảnh mình với sự cống hiến cũng to lớn như vậy. Nhưng con đường của chàng tới thành phố vàng là một kiểu khác. Nam Nhân Mã sẵn sàng tiến thẳng đến Oz hay Shangrila với một cái áo cổ lọ cắp dưới nách và một cái bàn chải đánh răng trong túi áo.<br/>Còn tiếp&#8230;<br/>', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Đại từ “tôi” trong bài ý chỉ tác giả, không phải dịch giả.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Cứ mỗi lần hai đứa cùng cung yêu nhau là y như rằng có cảm giác đang đọc SUN SIGNS của cung đó, haha (´ΦωΦ`)!<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Nam Bảo Bình và nữ Bảo Bình<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Cách tính cung dựa trên quyểnLOVE SIGNScủaLinda Goodman.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>“Con đang nói vớ vẩn gì đấy cục cưng? Chẳng có ai vô nhà mình mà không cần gõ cửa hết.”<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>“Con nghĩ ảnh đến bằng lối cửa sổ đó,” – con bé đáp.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>“Cưng ơi, cái này là tầng ba à nha.”<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>… oh, chắc là con bé ngủ mơ thiệt rồi.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Không. Ẻm không có mơ, hoàn toàn không. Anh trai Bảo Bình đúng là sẽ đi vào theo một cách độc đáo và khác thường nhất, giống như cách anh làm tất thảy những việc khác. Thật ra mà nói, bước vào một căn nhà, một phòng học, một rạp chiếu phim, một sân vận động, một nhà thờ, hoặc một cái chuồng gà bằng lối cửa sổ là vô cùng trần tục đáng chán với Công Tử Xách Nước nhà ta. Ảnh hoàn toàn có thể lộp bộp bước vào nhà với một cái ván lướt sóng hoặc giày trượt tuyết chẳng hạn. Tôi có biết một anh Xách Nước nha (một anh trưởng thành đấy nhé). Sở thích của anh là đi lại bằng cà kheo – cái thứ mà tôi hay leo lên và cà nhắc cà nhắc dọc con hẻm đằng sau nhà hồi con bé tẹo ấy. Anh ấy là quán quân cà kheo của cả xóm. Nói thiệt đấy. Anh còn tự làm cà kheo cho riêng mình mà. Một Công Tử Xách Nước khác mà tôi biết, tên là Bernie Friedman, trượt ván đi khắp mấy dãy nhà tại khu Bronx, hoặc đại lộ Cruger, kiểm tra điểm số dùm mấy đứa chơi đánh khăng trong khu, và những lời ca lộng lẫy anh ta viết ra bị kẹp dưới nách, đâu đó sau tai trái của ảnh có hình xăm của Frank Sinatra, ca sĩ anh yêu thích nhất, trong khi gặm gặm món thì là ngâm giảm cân chung với một cái donut mới nướng – ngoài ra ảnh còn đeo một cái huy hiệu trắng xanh in dòng chữ: Mong các thế lực đều đứng về phía bạn.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Những chàng Công Tử Xách nước nói trên, tất cả bọn họ, đều đến từ hành tinh khác. Đó là lý do logic duy nhất có thể giải thích cho việc làm sao mà họ lơ đãng đến thế. Tôi có một người bạn Bảo Bình có tên viết tắt là J.C. (Ê ê không phải Ông hoàng Đậu phộng đâu – và cũng không phải là ai nổi tiếng khác, dù rằng bạn tôi đúng là con cháu nhà Hebrew đó. Nhưng ảnh đến từ Wantagh, New York cơ, không phải Jerusalem). Dù sao chăng nữa thì, ờ Joel Cohen gần đây có đến thăm tôi. Trước khi ảnh đến ảnh có làm một cuộc điện thoại và hẹn tôi lúc 11 giờ trưa. Khi tôi hỏi sao anh không đến sớm hơn, và rồi chúng tôi có thể cùng ăn sáng, anh đáp rằng anh không muốn ép mình hẹn sớm hơn vì anh muốn có đủ thời gian để đi lạc vòng vòng (?) trong lúc tìm chỗ hẹn. Tôi nhìn ra ngay anh này thiệt là có đầu óc. Bảo Bình ấy mà, họ rất thường đi lạc, lúc đi tàu điện ngầm nè, trên xa lộ nè, ở sân bay nè… và đôi khi, trong chính căn nhà của họ nữa.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Dù là anh Công Tử Xách Nước có chọn cách nào để bước vào phòng chăng nữa, một khi anh đã lết xác được vào đến nơi, nếu bắt gặp một em gái Bảo Bình trong đấy, bốn mắt chắc chắn sẽ ngay lập tức cười với nhau (Hy: ê cái này dịch đúng đấy), rồi chớp chớp vài bận, sau đó bắt đầu thẩn thơ di chuyển lên trần nhà. (Mắt của dân Bảo Bình khó mà dính xuống đâu được. Y chang tính cách của mấy bạn ý.) Chỉ cần một trong hai bạn Xách Nước đấy mà đang dính với một ai đó rồi, hoặc đính hôn, hoặc đang yêu đương, hoặc cưới xin luôn chăng nữa, thì cả hai sẽ không màng đến chuyện mon men đến thân thiết với nhau đâu. Bội tín không phải là điểm đặc trưng của dân Bảo Bình. (Tôi không dám nói đến mấy bạn kém-đặc trưng. Nhưng mà ít nhất thì cũng có thể tin thế này, nếu họ có làm gì vượt quá giới hạn đạo đức, chắc chắn có một lý do tốt đẹp và lo-gic nằm sau nó. Lý do đó có thể khá là vô nghĩa với người khác, nhưng đối với Bảo Bình thì nó hoàn toàn thấu tình đạt lý à nha.) Và bởi vậy, nếu một hoặc cả hai bạn Bảo Bình điển hình của chúng ta đã thuộc về một người khác rồi (tức là đã kết dây tơ hồng với người khác trước), thì cả hai sẽ không điên cuồng yêu nhau hay lén lút hẹn hò hay phá vỡ quy tắc gì đâu. Thay vào đó, hai bạn chỉ đơn giản trở nên thân thiết và là những người bạn đơn thuần.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Mặt khác, nếu hai bạn đều đang không có bất cứ ràng buộc nào, và tự do đúng nghĩa để đi tìm hạnh phúc cho mình, thì vào giây phút lần đầu gặp nhau, hai bạn… cũng chỉ đến thế thôi (Hy: haha, Linda!). Hai bạn sẽ trở nên thân thiết và là những người bạn đơn thuần. Thường thì, sau một thời gian khá lâu, hai bạn mới nhận ra đứa kia khác giới tính với mình. Bảo Bình, cả nam lẫn nữ, đều đặt tình bạn lên trên tình yêu. Tình bạn là một cái đích to lớn trong cuộc đời họ &#8211; cái đích để trở thành bạn với tất cả các ông vua, bà hoàng, tổng thống, đại sứ viên, nông dân, ăn xin, người kén chọn, nhà khổ hạnh, người nướng bánh, và người làm nến… cả những con chó, con mèo, con la, bụi hồng, chim én, chim hoét, con nít, em bé, giám đốc, kiến, ruồi, ngựa, thú ăn kiến, ca sĩ, vũ công, thằng hề, và tất thảy voi trên hành tinh này. Theo lẽ thường thì họ không thể thực hiện trọn vẹn mục tiêu này. Nhưng có thể nói họ tiến rất rất gần đến đích rồi đấy.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Bạn thấy chứ, các bạn ấy tin vào tình bạn. Nhưng ái tình… tình yêu… đối với dân Xách Nước là một trạng thái tinh thần đáng nghi ngờ. Có một vài Bảo Bình sở hữu Mặt Trời bị xung khắc nghiêm trọng với những hành tinh xấu từ Nhà số Năm hoặc nhà số Tám thì dám sẽ sở hữu một đời sống tình dục dị giáo và đàng điếm đến độ bàng hoàng (Hy: cả hai Nhà đều có rất nhiều ý nghĩa, nhưng hai ý nghĩa Hy thấy có liên quan nhất là: nhà số Năm vốn do Sư Tử cai quản có liên hệ với sự “chơi bời” “phóng túng”, còn Nhà số Tám cai quản bởi Thần Nông là “tình dục”. Một số hành tinh được xem là “hành tinh xấu tự nhiên” là Thổ Tinh (rất nhiều), Hỏa Tinh (vừa vừa), Thiên Vương Tinh và Diêm Vương Tinh (chiêm tinh hiện đại). Tuy nhiên “xấu” hay “không xấu” còn tùy vào một số góc nhất định, phức tạp lắm :)). Nhưng số đông các anh chị em Bảo Bình đều có chung tư tưởng như sau: Tình cảm lãng mạn sẽ dẫn đến Tình yêu. Tình yêu sẽ dẫn đến Tình dục. Tình dục thì, đơn giản thôi, nó giống như nghiên cứu hai cái đồ hàn chì khác nhau. Một khi sự khác biệt giữa hai cái đồ hàn đấy được phát hiện, chứng minh, và thử nghiệm cẩn thận vài lần, thì tiếp tục nghiên cứu thêm đúng là phí phạm thời gian. Có quá nhiều chủ đề hấp dẫn trên thế giới để đào sâu nghiên cứu thay vì cứ dồn hết thời gian vào độc một món.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Thậm chí cả các bạn Sư Tử và Thần Nông cũng phải thừa nhận rằng các bạn trẻ Xách Nước có lý, ít nhất là về mặt lý thuyết. Tất cả những đứa con của Thiên Vương Tinh đều nghĩ, nói, và làm một cách lý thuyết – một cách trừu tượng – hoặc một cách học thuật. Bao gồm cả vụ yêu đương. Các bạn ấy hiếm khi yêu vì cảm thấy an toàn và đúng đắn, mà thường là vì các bạn thấy tò mò, và không thể chịu nổi bí mật này thêm một phút nào nữa… bí mật về Anh ấy, hoặc về Cô ấy.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Anh trai Bảo Bình yêu cầu em gái nào được anh chọn làm “người-bạn-đời-sẽ-dung-dăng-với-anh-trong-suốt-cuộc-hành-trình-vĩ-đại-của-Cuộc-đời” phải vượt lên trên hình ảnh của một người vợ, một bà chủ nhà, một người mẹ, một cô hầu gái. Anh sẽ kỳ vọng em sẽ là geisha của anh, bạn tâm tình của anh, thư ký của anh, người sẽ nghe anh xưng tội, đồng thời là người-bạn-thân-nhất-của-anh-trên-đời, bồ tèo của anh, đối tác của anh trong mọi kế hoạch điên rồ, xa xôi, thần diệu và bất khả thi nhất. Em cũng phải hứng thú với bè lũ bạn bè của anh (cái này thì chắc là một hội đông lắm nha), giỏi làm toán, có thể phân biệt được Uriah Heep và Ophelia, và đã từng đọc qua cũng như có thể đàm đạo thông thái với anh xem Sherlock Holmes đã bị Giáo sư Moriaty giết hay ngược lại (Em không cần biết câu trả lời đâu, chỉ cần có ý kiến nào nghe thú vị chút là được rồi.) Nếu em gái Bảo Bình mà anh yêu có thể đáp ứng được mọi điều đó, anh cũng có thể sẽ dành cho em nhiều điều kì diệu khác.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Hiển nhiên, em gái Bảo Bình cũng cơ bản yêu cầu những ngón ảo thuật tương tự từ phía anh. Em sẽ hy vọng anh phải là cái gì đấy vượt lên trên một cái cần câu cơm, một người chồng, một người cha, một người yêu, và vân vân. Anh sẽ phải là một người có uy tín trong cộng đồng Hindu đối với em (Hy: “a guru”, mọi người ai có cách dịch khác cứ cho ý kiến nhé!), thầy dạy judo của em, bố em, anh em, người-bạn-thân-nhất-trên-thế-giới-của-em, ông thầy tu Tây Tạng của em, Romeo của em, Valentino của em, Cleveland Amory của em (cái này là do ảnh hưởng từ cuộc vận động bảo vệ quyền động vật mới đây), và chắc chắn phải là Ralph Nader của em (Hy: chính trị gia, tác giả, diễn giả, chuyên về các vấn đề bảo vệ người tiêu dùng, nhân đạo, môi trường…) và Amory Lovins của em (người đã phát kiến ra việc sử dụng các nguồn năng lượng tái tạo như năng lượng Mặt Trời đấy).<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Và quan trọng nè, anh phải làm em nhớ tới thằng người yêu đầu tiên của em, cái đứa từng lén lút tặng em một bông hoa cúc rách tả tơi trong lớp Đại số… cũng như em phải cực kì giống với cái con bé mà anh yêu đầu tiên, cái con bé có một bên mắt xanh và một bên mắt nâu, con bé đẹp nhất trong lớp Hình học mà anh từng cho nó mượn khăn tay vào một buổi chiều khi con bé cứ sụt sùi không nguôi bởi vì nó bỏ qua mấy cái tam giác đều.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Bạn thấy rồi chứ, những yêu cầu về một người yêu vĩnh-cữu của dân Bảo Bình thật là nặng nề, chẳng trách làm sao quá trời đứa ế dài hạn đến cuối đời. Bạn cần kha khá kinh nghiệm thực tiễn để có đủ tư cách làm vợ anh – hoặc làm chồng em. Không phải kinh nghiệm trong tình yêu hay tình dục hay cái quái gì ngu ngốc tương tự đâu. Là kinh nghiệm sống bình thường thôi. Chỉ cần chạm đúng nọc, và biến nó thành kinh nghiệm sống “phi thường” là được.<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Còn tiếp&#8230;<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><br/>Trích dịch quyển LOVE SIGNS của Linda Goodman. Đại từ “tôi” trong bài ý chỉ tác giả, không phải dịch giả.<b></b><b></b><br/>Hai bạn trẻ hạnh phúc quá nha( //Д//).:*♥!<b></b><b></b><br/>Vui lòng đọc Hướng dẫn trước khi đọc tạiĐÂY.<b></b><b></b><br/>Nam Bảo Bình và nữ Bảo Bình<b></b><b></b><br/>Cách tính cung dựa trên quyểnLOVE SIGNScủaLinda Goodman.<b></b><b></b><br/>Một khi hai bạn trẻ đáp ứng được những yêu cầu tinh tế, phức tạp, lồi lõm vặn xoắn của đối phương, và dĩ nhiên với điểm số xuất sắc, thì anh trai và em gái này rất có thể đạt được sự hòa hợp gối chăn với nhau. Cả anh và em đều hiểu rõ một trong những bí mật tuyệt vời nhất của tình yêu là sự khan hiếm sẽ khiến bất cứ thứ gì trở nên thấm thía hơn, và làm tình thì cũng y như thế. Không phải hai đứa sẽ sống thanh tịnh như anh trai em gái với nhau đâu, không đời nào, nhưng nếu mà là dân Xách Nước chính hiệu thì hai đứa chắc chắn không thỏa mãn những gì cơ thể cần chỉ vì nó cần như vậy. Khi hai đứa thể hiện cảm xúc thông qua cơ thể, ham muốn của tụi nó thường được xây dựng từ từ, bắt đầu bằng việc bốn mắt nhìn nhau cười vào bữa sáng hoặc bữa tối. Tôi nói “thường” đấy. Những lúc khác (không thường xuyên, cũng không họa hoằn), hai đứa có thể đột ngột nhảy bổ vào nhau, hoàn toàn không ngờ trước được, và bùng nổ. Đơn giản là nhu cầu bộc phát, và nối tiếp bằng sự thỏa mãn thầm lặng và tức thì.<b></b><b></b><br/>Nếu cung Mặt Trăng và cung Mọc của cái cặp 1-1 này hòa hợp với nhau, con đường trải hoa hồng mà hai đứa từng mơ đến sẽ trải ra trước mắt…. nhưng nếu vị trí của Mặt Trăng – Mặt Trời hoặc cung Mọc bị xung khắc trong biểu đồ ngày sinh chung của hai đứa thì bản chất của cả hai sẽ trùng nhau ở một đặc tính nào đấy (có thể tốt, cũng có thể rất kì quặc). Và hai đứa phải điều chỉnh ghê gớm lắm nếu thực sự muốn chung sống hòa bình với nhau.<b></b><b></b><br/>Một ví dụ này, khả năng cao là hai đứa sẽ thích bạn bè của đứa kia quá đáng. Đa phần các cặp đôi đều gặp vấn đề trong việc “thích” nổi bạn bè của người kia. Nhưng cặp này thì không. Cũng bởi tụi nó quá sức tò mò và bị hấp dẫn bởi lũ bạn bè chung, nên đêm nào đấy một đứa có thể bỗng dưng bỏ đi lang với một trong số lũ bạn bè kia… nhưng không có nghĩa là tụi nó ngoại tình đâu, có thể chỉ bàn luận về việc mở một sàn disco cho lũ phi cơ lái UFO, hoặc mở một cửa hàng thực phẩm dinh dưỡng cho hươu cao cổ. Cũng có thể là bàn luận về khả năng anh Bảo Bình (hoặc em Bảo Bình đó) đắc cử Tổng Thống. Đấy, làm sao mà ái tình lãng mạn có thể đơm hoa khi mà bếp lúc nào cũng lúc nhúc bạn bè, phòng khách cũng lúc nhúc bạn bè và giường ngủ thì có hẳn một đống áo khoác và khăn choàng và áo gió của những luồng bạn bè không bao giờ ngớt?<b></b><b></b><br/>Một đặc tính khác có thể làm rối chuyện thêm nếu bị phóng đại quá mức đây: sự Kiên Định mà tất cả các bạn Bảo Bình sở hữu. Kiên Định có nghĩa là cứng đầu, tăng thêm một tí. Trong trường hợp các anh trai và em gái nhà Thiên Vương Tinh, cái tính này còn được thêu dệt thành những hành động hết sức khó lường, thành ra ta có thể hiểu rằng các bạn này đã nhân đôi cái hội chứng cứng-đầu-sáng- tạo-không-cổ điển lên. Tỷ như, anh ta sẽ cực cứng rắn trong việc đòi hỏi con chó của anh, Jeep, phải được ngủ chung với hai đứa vào mỗi tối, và cuộn mình nằm ngay dưới cằm anh. Bạn thử nghĩ coi, thiệt là khó khăn khi muốn hôn chúc ngủ ngon một anh đang quấn một con chó tha mồi Labrador quanh cổ. Bạn sẽ không thể biết được ai đang hôn đáp lại bạn, anh trai bạn yêu hay con chó của ảnh. Và kiểu này dễ làm em nào thích được âu yếm trước khi ngủ chưng hửng lắm nha. Hoặc… em có thể cực cứng rắn trong việc khăng khăng rằng mình phải được lái xe của anh, dù rằng em làm cho con xe xoắn quanh cái hộp thư hai lần trong vòng một tuần cơ đấy, chưa kể còn có một mớ phiếu phạt đậu xe và chạy quá tốc độ đầy nhóc trong cái hộc trên xe rồi. Điều đó làm một anh Bảo Bình bực ghê gớm, vì anh còn muốn có phương tiện di chuyển để đi lại dài dài. Với cả, thuyết phục một Bảo Bình thay đổi ý kiến về bất cứ thứ gì là gần như không tưởng (còn muốn sai khiến họ thay đổi thì đúng là hoàn toàn bất khả thi luôn).<b></b><b></b><br/>May thay, thậm chí các anh trai và em gái Bảo Bình nào có Mặt Trời và Mặt Trăng không hòa hợp lắm cũng có thể đưa ra những giải pháp nhẹ nhàng cho vấn đề căng thẳng song phương. Cả hai có thể tập trung vào những mục tiêu nhân đạo hoặc khoa học của riêng mình hoặc của cả hai. Bằng cách đó, tụi nó sẽ chẳng còn mấy thời gian để mà cãi nhau về vụ tính-Kiên-Định nữa. Thực tế là có cực kì nhiều những cặp vợ chồng truyền giáo, cặp đôi thám hiểm và nghiên cứu khoa học, cả các cây bút hay hợp tác với nhau, đều là cặp Bảo Bình – Bảo Bình. Cả hai đều có thể dẹp đi cái tôi của bản thân khi cống hiến hết mình cho một mục tiêu lý tưởng nào đó, và vì thế, cũng gặp ít rủi ro trong việc đánh mất người mình yêu vì những mối bất hòa và những nỗi niềm bất ổn hơn. Cũng không nhất thiết là phải dắt díu nhau đi thám hiểu Châu Phi hay leo dãy Himalaya để tìm kiếm những thầy tu Tây Tạng đức cao vọng trọng hay hợp tác làm việc trong một phòng thí nghiệm dát crôm đâu. Hai bạn ý có thể tham gia vào những thứ đời thường và trần tục hơn mà, tỷ như huấn luyện mấy con gorilla con, mở một cửa tiệm bán xe đạp một bánh, kiểm tra mấy cái dù bị hư, nghiên cứu những trải nghiệm thoát xác bằng cách thôi miên tại Kim tự tháp Cheops bên Ai Cập, hoặc viết một quyển sách giải thích rằng Cheops không hề xây nên Kim tự tháp Giza và tiết lộ xem thực ra ai mới là tác giả của nó… hiển nhiên, hai bạn hạnh phúc mà làm những điều trên cùng nhau. Vâng, tôi biết rằng mấy cái ngành nghề đúp mà tôi vừa gợi ý nó chẳng hề “đời thường và trần tục” tí nào đối với bạn, và cả tôi nữa, nhưng đối với các anh trai và em gái Bảo Bình, mấy thứ trên quả thực không quái lạ bất thường hay dị hợm gì cho cam đâu.<b></b><b></b><br/>Như tôi đã từng nói trong quyển này rồi ha, và trong cả Sun Signs nữa, những đứa con của Thiên Vương Tinh tin vào sự thay đổi – nhưng trừ những thay đổi liên quan đến chính họ. Anh sẽ có xu hướng tin rằng mọi thứ và mọi người trên thế giới đều nên thay đổi, bao gồm cả em (bồ tèo thân thiết của anh), nhưng anh khước từ phải thay đổi dù chỉ chút xíu trong cái khuôn khổ thói quen cá nhân của anh. Em cũng có xu hướng tin – và khước từ &#8211; y chang luôn. Thế nên hiển nhiên một trong hai sẽ phải nhận ra sai lầm trong cái kiểu suy nghĩ mù quáng này. Tốt nhất là cả hai luôn đi.<b></b><b></b><br/>Những giây phút hạnh phúc bên nhau của hai đứa có thể là những lúc tụi nó ném cho nhau mấy quả bất ngờ. Bảo Bình thích được cho và nhận những bất ngờ. Hai đứa sẽ hiếm khi tiết lộ kế hoạch cá nhân của mình ra ngoài trước thì hoàn thành chúng. Con xe Ford model T anh tặng em vào Giáng Sinh sẽ là một bất ngờ toàn diện. Khỏi đoán luôn. Rồi cái tin em đóng một cái nhà cho chó ngay cạnh giường ngủ của hai đứa, nơi Jeep có thể ngủ vào bất cứ tối Thứ Ba nào sẽ không bao giờ đến tai anh. Nhưng rồi nó sẽ đột nhiên xuất hiện để làm anh sốc chơi vào một buổi sáng đẹp trời nào đó, lúc anh tỉnh giấc vì tưởng rằng Jeep đang hôn mũi mình, nhưng rồi nhận ra nó vẫn đang ngáy pho pho thỏa mãn trong căn nhà mới của nó cách đấy vài feet – và người đang hôn anh là bồ tèo của anh cơ. Bồ tèo lâu năm tốt bụng của anh, bạn thân nhất của anh, em gái dòm cực kì giống người yêu đầu đời của anh, em đã làm anh quên mất tên cái cô người yêu đầu đó luôn rồi. Nhưng anh Bảo Bình mà quên tên vợ ảnh thì cũng có thể lắm chứ. Tên tuổi đâu có thành vấn đề đâu. Anh nhớ những điều quan trọng nhất về em, giống như là… em dòm thế nào khi tóc em còn ướt sau khi bơi hoặc gội đầu… cách mà giọng của em xoa dịu tinh thần anh khi em kể chuyện Tolkien cho anh trước khi đi ngủ… và cách mà em chữa cháy mấy món bánh bó xôi và kem vào buổi sáng cho anh.<b></b><b></b><br/>Em gái Bảo Bình cũng thuộc dạng đãng trí có cỡ đấy. Em có thể thi thoảng quên tên người yêu hay chồng em, khi em đang bận rộn làm những công việc khác như là xẻ gỗ cất nhà cho chó chẳng hạn, hoặc viết luận văn về sự phát triển camera trong quá khứ, sử dụng tinh thể thạch anh để làm ống kính… nhưng em sẽ vẫn nhớ những điểm quan trọng. Em sẽ nhớ anh là người đầu tiên có thể chỉ cho em xem Sirius và Orion là ngôi sao nào trên trời… anh là người giải thích cho em nếu sử dụng toilet không cần nước phổ biến thì có thể cứu được hành tinh này như thế nào… là người tặng em thẻ hội viên của National Geographic làm quà cưới, và một bộ dụng cụ để chỉnh dây xe vào ngày sinh nhật. Rồi, hiển nhiên, sẽ có những khoảng khắc… nhu cầu bộc phát… và đáp ứng ngay lập tức… vô cùng bất ngờ thôi… và cái cách đôi mắt anh cười với em sau đấy. Những thứ đấy em chắc chắn sẽ nhớ mãi mãi, đấy là kết quả tất yếu.<b></b><b></b><br/>HOÀN.<b></b><b></b><br/>', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Song Ngư nữ tính. Sự kết hợp của hai cung này sẽ cho ra kết quả như thế nào? Dành cho những cặp đôi nào thuộc cung này nhé.<br/><blockquote>Cô ấy không nên tự làm mình lầm lẫn chỉ vì khi cô ấy đánh rơi chiếc áo lông angora (một loại dê thỏ hay gì đấy có lông mượt, không có từ chính xác trong từ điển :D) của mình, anh taĐẠPlên nó với một đôi giày đầy sình; hoặc anh ta đưa cô ấy đi xem phim, rồi tự lang thang thẩn thơ lên ban công để nhóp nhép món bắp rang một mình (thật ra vì anh ta quên xừ nó chỗ hai người ngồi là ở đâu rồi (!)); hoặc anh ta gọi cho cô ấy và hỏi xem anh ấy có thể mời… chó của cô ấy đi tản bộ không, mà không đoái hoài gì đến việc mời cô ta; hoặc là anh ta thổi một cái túi giấy và đập cho nó nổ bên cạnh tai cô nàng rồi phá ra cười điên dại, trong khi cô ấy thắc mắc không biết anh ấy có để ý mình dùng mùi nước hoa mới không.<br/></blockquote>Cứ tin tưởng là một nữ nhân Song Ngư sẽ thấy được những điều mà các cô nàng kém nhạy cảm và kém sâu sắc hơn thường bỏ qua. Đúng đấy, bỏ qua vài điểm lạ đời, vài hành vi kì quặc thấy rõ, vài lúc mà tai anh ta ngọ nguậy một cách bất thường, bỏ qua luôn sự lơ đãng và ánh nhìn xa xăm của anh ấy, anh chàng này được sinh ra dưới một chòm sao nam tính, thêm nữa lại được chiếu mệnh bởi một hành tinh cũng nam tính (nam tính gấp đôi :D??? Giống Nhân Mã a~). Hơn thế nữa, anh ta theo chủ nghĩa lý tưởng, là người bảo vệ những kẻ thân cô thế cô. Không ai có thể phù hợp để đóng vai ĐÀN ÔNG hơn là nam nhân Bảo Bình. Anh ta có thể giống như Flash Gordon, hoặc Clark Kent, siêu phù hợp để chống lại bàn tay của mọi tai ương, và do vậy, rất ư là phù hợp để bảo vệ nàng công chúa của anh ta trước mọi hiểm nguy. Anh ta là đàn ông của mọi đàn ông, thể loại hay làm nữ nhân đổ như rạ trong phim ảnh ấy.<br/>Hoàn cảnh run rủi thế nào khi ánh nhìn xa xăm của anh ta bỗng nhiên dừng lại trên một cô gái Hải Vương. Tương phản hài hòa với sự nam tính của anh ấy là sự nữ tính của cô ấy. Nên nhớ rằng, Song Ngư là một chòm sao nữ tính, và cô ấy cũng được chiếu mệnh bởi một ngôi sao nữ tính. Sự tương phản làm nên sức hấp dẫn! Hai người này tự nhiên sẽ bị thu hút bởi nhau trong vòng vài phút sau khi gặp mặt. Nếu có một cô gái nào có thể khiến cho anh chàng Mang Nước chuyển hứng thú từ dòm ngó con người hoặc điều tra gì đấy sang nghiền ngẫm những điều riêng tư về bản chất con người hơn, đó chắc chắn là một cô tiểu Ngư Ngư.<br/>Như tôi đã nói đâu đó trong quyển sách này (và cả trong quyển sách đầu tiên của tôi, Sun Signs nữa), theo một quy luật nhất định, nam nhân Bảo Bình không bao giờ quá vướng bận về vụ hấp dẫn giới tính. Tuy thế, khi anh ta gặp một cô nàng Song Ngư, anh chàng bỗng nhiên ngộ ra sự bản năng giới tính của mình (cả của cô ấy nữa), khiến cho anh ta bắt đầu cư xử một cách kì quặc. Không chỉ là kì quặc hơn anh ta bình thường đâu, mà là VÔ CÙNG KÌ QUẶC. Có khi còn khiến cho cô ấy nghĩ là anh ta ghét cô ra mặt nữa cơ.<br/>Cô ấy không nên tự làm mình lầm lẫn chỉ vì khi cô ấy đánh rơi chiếc áo lông angora (một loại dê thỏ hay gì đấy có lông mượt, không có từ chính xác trong từ điển :D) của mình, anh ta ĐẠP lên nó với một đôi giày đầy sình; hoặc anh ta đưa cô ấy đi xem phim, rồi tự lang thang thẩn thơ lên ban công để nhóp nhép món bắp rang một mình (thật ra vì anh ta quên xừ nó chỗ hai người ngồi là ở đâu rồi (!)); hoặc anh ta gọi cho cô ấy và hỏi xem anh ấy có thể mời… chó của cô ấy đi tản bộ không, mà không đoái hoài gì đến việc mời cô ta; hoặc là anh ta thổi một cái túi giấy và đập cho nó nổ bên cạnh tai cô nàng rồi phá ra cười điên dại, trong khi cô ấy thắc mắc không biết anh ấy có để ý mình dùng mùi nước hoa mới không. Thật ra anh ta CÓ để ý. Anh ta có đấy, có thật đấy! Đó là lý do tại sao anh ta thổi túi rồi đập. Vì nó khiến cho tay anh ta bận rộn, thay vì vươn ra và nhẹ nhàng chạm vào má cô ấy. Chỉ có bọn ẻo lả mới làm trò đó. Và đời nào anh ta là đồ ẻo lả. Bọn bạn từ hồi đóng bỉm, bạn để bù khú, bạn nói chung luôn, sẽ nghĩ gì? Cái kiểu ngu si này là của bọn sến, không phải của thằng cha này. Ê coi chừng, hắn đang tới kìa!<br/>Cô gái Song Ngư nào hay dùng nước mắt rửa mặt bởi vì chàng trai Bảo Bình mà mình yêu không hiểu sao luôn đối xử với cô ấy một cách thờ ơ (cố ý), cứ như là cô ta làm anh cụt hứng (trong khi sự thật là cô ta làm anh ta hứng khởi đến độ quên cả năm nay là năm nào), cô nên nhớ vài dòng sau đây tôi sáng tác cho những ai đang trong hoàn cảnh này<br/>Anh phải đi rồi<br/>Đừng níu kéo với ánh nhìn như thế<br/>Tim em cũng đừng hướng tới anh như thế<br/>Hoặc là tim anh sẽ vỡ nát<br/>Yêu em? Đấy là hiển nhiên<br/>Vậy nên anh phải ra đi.. trước khi em biết rằng<br/>Anh yêu em đến nhường nào.<br/>[Xin lỗi này là đại ý thôi, dịch giả không có khả năng thi ca để có thể dịch bay bướm hơn được =.=. Thông cảm thông cảm!!!!]<br/>Hai người này về khoản chăn gối là hết ý luôn. Vào tuần trăng mật chẳng hạn. Ừm đúng vậy tôi nói là họ có thể tiến xa đến tận tuần trăng mật cơ đấy (ý tác giả là bà chắc chắn cặp này có thể cưới nhau). Một khi cô gái Hải Vương nhận ra được cái kiểu làm bộ làm tịch vô cùng lãng mạn của anh chàng, thế là ngừng khóc, và bắt đầu quyến rũ anh ta, bảo đảm anh ta không có cơ hội trốn thoát! Vào tuần trăng mật, có khi họ tốn cả đống thời gian để giải mấy câu hỏi khùng khùng tựa như: Nếu hai chiếc đồng hồ chuột Mickey (chuột Mickey???) của họ càng ngày càng chạy lệch giờ nhau thì bao giờ chúng lại có thể chạy cùng giờ như trước. Anh ta sẽ sử dụng đại số, trong khi cô ấy sẽ trầm ngâm. Theo suy luận Hải Vương khó hiểu của cô nàng, cô ta sẽ nhận xét rằng điều đó là không thể, vì bà ngoại cô ấy dạy rằng hai cái sai không làm nên một cái đúng. Anh ta sẽ không buồn nghe. Anh ta đang bận tính toán mà. Tiếp đó, lại cũng theo lối “suy luận Hải Vương khó hiểu” đó, cô ấy sẽ hỏi là đề bài có đúng là “khi nào hai chiếc đồng hồ chạy CÙNG giờ” hay là “chạy ĐÚNG giờ”. Mấy câu hỏi kiểu này sẽ khiến anh ta vứt đồ chuốt bút chì của mình trong một cơn bực mình. Cô ấy vẫn sẽ bình thản như cũ, và vẫn theo lối “suy luận Hải Vương khó hiểu”, cô ấy sẽ nở một nụ cười thần tiên và thì thầm rằng, chừng nào anh ta còn muốn làm tình, “bất cứ khi nào cũng ĐÚNG giờ”. Tai anh ta sẽ đỏ như trái cà chua chín, anh ta sẽ cười toe toét, rồi lột cái đồng hồ chuột Mickey ra, và… đèn tắt :D.<br/>Tôi thường không đề cập đến quan hệ vợ chồng của mấy cặp cung Hoàng đạo sớm như vậy, nhưng mà giữa một người đàn ông trăm phần trăm và một người phụ nữ trăm phần trăm, mấy việc này chóng xảy ra lắm. Thật ra thì không nên bức họ đỏ mặt (cả hai đều dễ đỏ mặt lắm) bằng cách miêu tả kĩ lưỡng mối quan hệ thể xác của họ hòa hợp đến mức nào. Tất cả đều do Tạo hóa cả, và điều này có nghĩa là mối quan hệ của họ rất êm thấm, suôn sẻ, và hòa hợp. Trừ trường hợp xung khắc giữa thuộc tính (Mặt Trời và Mặt Trăng) của họ, hoặc giờ sinh của họ đồng thời bị chiếu bởi một ngôi sao tiêu cực nào đấy, thì hai người này mới gặp phải trở ngại trong chuyện gối chăn. Mà thôi có lẽ dừng ở đây thôi, vì chắc rằng cả Song Ngư lẫn Bảo Bình đều ghét bị người khác chõ mũi vào chuyện riêng tư của mình, dù từ anh lớn chị lớn nào chăng nữa.<br/>Còn tiếp&#8230;<br/>Trích dịch quyển LOVE SIGNS của Linda Goodman. Đại từ &#8220;tôi&#8221; trong bài ý chỉ tác giả, không phải dịch giả.<br/>Bảo Bình nam tính. Song Ngư nữ tính. Sự kết hợp của hai cung này sẽ cho ra kết quả như thế nào? Dành cho những cặp đôi nào thuộc cung này nhé.<br/><blockquote>Nó thật tuyệt vời để yêu và được yêu bởi một thiên tài. Cuộc sống đôi khi hơi khùng điên đôi chút, nhưng không bao giờ đơn điệu. Cô ấy sẽ không bao giờ biết được điều gì đang đón chờ mình. Giống như ngay bây giờ đây, anh ta bảo cô dòm thử vào ngăn kéo bàn xem sao. Tò mò, cô mở ra, và trong đấy là một chiếc áo lông angora, với một chiếc khăn quàng hợp tông. “Ngạc nhiên chưa?” anh ấy hỏi, và nháy mắt với cô ấy. “Dễ thương quá!” – cô ấy đáp lại – “Nhưng nhân dịp gì đấy?”<br/></blockquote><br/>Hiển nhiên, họ không hoàn toàn thuận buồm xuôi gió đâu, bởi vì cô ta quá lão luyện trong việc nhìn thấu tâm can những người cô ấy từng gặp, và anh ta thì tốt nghiệp chuyên ngành điều tra phân tích bất cứ câu “Xin chào” nào từ bạn bè (cả người lạ nữa) và cuối cùng kết luận ra cả lịch sử cuộc đời người đó.<br/>Thi thoảng, vì sự không hoàn hảo của mình, cô nàng Tiểu Ngư sẽ vô tình làm vài thứ chọc tiết anh chàng Bảo bình. Bất cứ anh chàng Bảo Bình nào cũng có vấn đề trong việc bỏ qua mọi thứ. Thay vì làm ngơ bất cứ xích mích nào giữa bọn họ, mà đáng lẽ anh ta nên làm thế, vì cô nàng này siêu cấp mẫn cảm, anh ta lại bị kích động làm cho một trận ra ngô ra khoai rằng anh ta đúng còn cô ấy sai. Thử lấy một ví dụ nhé, anh ta sẽ gieo một ít hạt giống hoa bên cạnh luống bắp cải và khoai tây với ý tưởng sẽ làm cây mọc tốt hơn (??) và anh ta quên nói điều này với cô ấy. Ngày nào ấy, cô ấy đi tưới bắp cải, thấy đống mầm hoa, và nhổ chúng lên vì cho rằng chúng là cây dại. Anh ta sẽ ngay lập tức sinh khí, khiến cô ấy sợ hãi thu người vào trong tổn thương trầm lặng, mắt sẽ ngân ngấn và tay thì run rẩy. Nếu cô ấy còn ngoan cố đấy chỉ là mầm cây dại, anh ta sẽ phản pháo bằng cách đem một cây con mà cô ấy vừa nhổ lên và trồng vào một cái ống nhổ bằng đồng. Bảo Bình sẽ chăm bẵm cho nó trong vòng bí mật, nói chuyện với nó, hát với nó, bón cho nó thức ăn thực vật. Và khi nó bừng nở thành một bông hoa xinh đẹp, với những cánh hoa mượt mà, một bông hoa bướm (pansy) với sắc vàng và tím, anh ta sẽ ném nó ngay trước bàn điểm tâm của cô ấy, và nói một cách đắc thắng “Nhìn đi! Đây là một cái MẦM CÂY DẠI mà cô bỏ sót lúc cô thanh trừng ruộng rau đấy.”. Cô ấy sẽ ù té bỏ chạy lên lầu, đóng sầm cửa phòng ngủ, và khóc, bởi vì anh ta tốn quá nhiều công sức chỉ để chứng minh rằng cô ấy sai, còn anh chàng Bảo Bình thì hẳn là không hiểu tại sao cô ấy đau lòng đến như vậy. Với cách làm đấy thì ảnh hưởng quá mạnh mẽ của sao Thiên Vương (lên Bảo Bình) sẽ tổn thương sự mong manh của sao Hải Vương. Sau vài năm chung sống, có lẽ anh ta sẽ học được cách cư xử nhẹ nhàng hơn với trái tim mềm yếu của cô ấy, và cô ấy sẽ học được rằng khi anh ta gắng sống gắng chết chứng minh rằng ta đúng từ chuyện lớn nhất đến chuyện nhỏ nhất thì anh ta cũng không bớt yêu cô ta đi chút nào. Tuy nhiên trước khi họ học được điều đó, nước mắt sẽ còn phải chảy đấy.<br/>Với cấu trúc của một cặp 2-12 (ai đọc sách này sẽ hiểu, riêng người dịch đã đọc nhưng không hiểu nên kệ luôn), cô ấy có sức chịu đựng anh ấy nhiều hơn bất cứ cung Hoàng đạo nào khác, bởi vì đối với cô ấy, anh ấy biểu tưởng cho Ngôi nhà số 12 của Định mệnh, nơi mà cô ấy lui về với tần suất nhiều hơn số lần cô ấy được gọi về. Cô ấy không muốn quay về bên vụ tập trung vào điều tra và hiếu kì nữa, bởi vì cô ấy chuyên nghiệp trong khoản chấp nhận mọi thứ BẰNG NIỀM TIN, nhưng cô ấy nhớ rõ những kinh nghiệm của Bảo Bình về cạm bẫy cuộc đời, và cô ấy đồng tình với nó,. Với anh ấy cô ta đại diện cho bài học về bước tiến hóa mới của loài người, nhưng tôi không chắc rằng anh ta muốn học đâu. Nhưng qua góc nhìn của cô ấy, thỉnh thoảng anh ta vẫn học được điều này hoặc khác, đặc biệt là qua các ví dụ.<br/>Trừ phi Thần Vệ Nữ bị sao quả tạ chiếu ngay ngày sinh của cô ấy, không thì một phụ nữ Song Ngư điển hình tương đối không bị chi phối bởi lòng ghen tị như các chị em khác trong cung Hoàng đạo. Cô ấy ít khi nào nghi ngờ anh ấy thiếu chung thủy, do vậy khiến mối quan hệ của họ bớt sóng gió hơn. Thực ra cũng ít có điều kiện để nghi ngờ anh chàng này, bởi vì Bảo Bình điển hình nhận thấy tầm quan trọng trong mối quan hệ nam nữ với MỘT phụ nữ duy nhất và KHÔNG có việc chạy lòng vòng để làm sự việc thêm phức tạp. Đam mê tâm hồn và thể xác đều tuyệt, và anh ấy không ghét cái nào hết. Thực ra thì anh ta điều tra thử rồi và thấy hai thứ này đều được thỏa mãn tuyệt đối. Không cần sợ hãi việc anh ta léng phéng với cô nàng hàng xóm, dù cô ta có mặc áo tắm đến chỉ để mượn cái kéo tỉa hàng rào. Anh ta có thể vui vẻ với hình ảnh cô nàng áo tắm một chút, quay ra chọc cô vợ Song Ngư của mình, rồi quay lại với thứ anh ta đang dở tay, có thể là bầu cử đại biểu quốc hội hay đọc Sherlock Holmes, trồng cây cho nhà thực vật mới của họm hoặc là cho vẹt ăn.<br/>Cô ấy sẽ cười, giúp anh ấy một chút khi cần, hoặc để anh ấy tự do một chút và thoải mái lăng xăng với những gì anh trong đầu anh ấy. <blockquote>Nó thật tuyệt vời để yêu và được yêu bởi một thiên tài. Cuộc sống đôi khi hơi khùng điên đôi chút, nhưng không bao giờ đơn điệu. Cô ấy sẽ không bao giờ biết được điều gì đang đón chờ mình. Giống như ngay bây giờ đây, anh ta bảo cô dòm thử vào ngăn kéo bàn xem sao. Tò mò, cô mở ra, và trong đấy là một chiếc áo lông angora, với một chiếc khăn quàng hợp tông. “Ngạc nhiên chưa?” anh ấy hỏi, và nháy mắt với cô ấy. “Dễ thương quá!” – cô ấy đáp lại – “Nhưng nhân dịp gì đấy?”<br/></blockquote>Thật ra hôm nay là kỉ niệm ngày cưới của họ, mà anh ta thì chẳng có chút khái niệm mơ hồ nào về nó. Nhưng mà cô ấy sẽ chẳng nói gì đâu. Cô ấy chỉ cười và tặng anh ấy một nụ hôn gió, rồi tưới cho cây hoa bướm (pansy) bên bệ cửa sổ.<br/>Happy Ending :D.<br/>', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Nevertheless, their behavior can be quite erratic and chaotic, and their subconscious and unconscious mind functions in a rather different way than of the rest people. These traits can in the native’s young years create alienation from the other children, who will frequently consider him as bizarre and weird.<br />\nUranus in the twelfth gives a lot of psychic abilities, and can manifest in various (and personally unique) ways in the native’s life. The 12th house rules dreams and sleep, and a lot of information will come as insight to the native during his sleeping hours. They might discover inventions or otherwise achieve some kind of success after either seeing dreams of what they should invent or do. &nbsp;Sudden ideas will strike like lightning bolts in their heads. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSuch a native will be able to conceive complex ideas that might inspire him in his work, concrete answers for problems that dwell in his mind, while also even see future events. Those will many times be masqueraded under archetypes of the collective unconscious, and a wise individual with such a natal aspect should research further the world of psychology, ethnology and occult to understand the meanings that can be hidden behind them. In any case, Uranus placed here will definitely bring secret researches of matters connected with the outer realms. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIn his everyday reality, the individual will experience quite a lot of hassle from this placement. He may have awkward sleeping hours, or even change night with day and become a night owl. Many times, he might experiment with days that last 30 or even more hours, and generally develop rather weird patterns of sleep. Also, this placement will bring a very vivid fantasy, and his dreams will be frequently lucid. Difficult aspects with other planets will definitely bring nightmares, as also insomnia.<br />\nIn some circumstances, Uranus in the 12th house will bring paranormal experiences of a rather uncontrolled nature, frequently leaving the native in awe and wonder about what happened. These experiences can be profound and life-changing, and in case that the individual acquires the necessary knowledge and practice he can consciously turn into a mage. Involvement with secret organizations is also something possible to happen, but if Uranus is adversely aspected the native is firmly advised to be a lone wolf in his researches, as he can create secret enemies. In such a circumstance, as the 12th house also rules illegal activities, the native should keep away from them as there is big possibility of things going wrong and facing the natural outcomes.<br />\nThe native with such a natal aspect will have quite a lot of periods when he will need loneliness, and will probably develop some rather eccentric hobby. This hobby might be practiced secretly, even though there is no real reason behind such a choice. The person may use this hobby as a personal way of meditation and obtaining the necessary solitude for making his introspection. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAs a result of your unconventional lifestyle you may have many things that you wish to keep secret. You tend, also, to hide your originality or some eccentricity. You may have been carefree and independent as a young person, but now you are concerned about your reputation and being conventional, at least a bit. You analytical mind is very useful in terms of dealing with hidden matters. A worker on confidential matters, a secret scientist &#8211; these and others are possibilities. You may be an unconventional healer. You could be rebelling against large institutions such as prisons, hospitals and places of seclusion. There could be hidden enemies who use strange, occult or new techniques. You may be the effect of dramatic changes in institutions, which may bring good or ill.<br />\nStrange clothes that catch attention, eccentric haircuts and general look are very frequent for 12th house Uranus people, especially if the planet is residing near the Ascendant. Such people usually have a tall body; the native can be significantly taller than both of his parents and other relatives.<br />\nMany times, Uranus in the 12th house can create a revolutionary without cause. The person just has an internal need to confront the system around him, no matter if there is a real need for change. He receives joy from provocation and discord, and even negative comments about him can boost his ego. He likes to be different from the mass and being ostracized is for him a medal reward and not a punishment. Uranus rising people enjoy feeling themselves as heroes of some kind, and constantly fantasize about becoming so in reality. Of course, some of them indeed reach such kind of achievements!<br />\nIn addition, if Uranus in the twelfth is aspecting planets responsible for one’s sexuality or elsehow connected with the 5th and 8th house, the native will definitely indulge in secret love affairs and other types of clandestine behavior.<br />\nUranus Rising individuals should be very careful when handling electrical devices. If the planet is aspected by malefic planets, there is possibility of accidental electrocution or even being hit by a lightning.

The planet is famous for bringing weird situations concerning the matters of the house that it is located, which are usually out of the native’s control.<br />\nUranus here is domicile, as Aquarius is the natural ruler of the eleventh house. The planet feels at home and manifests at full power, making it probably the best natal placement it can have. Uranus here will bring quite a lot of unconventional friends, who will try to establish groups that will promote humanism, altruism and progressive ideas for a better world.<br />\nThe native will choose friends of various characters, without having barriers and social taboos. He will attract alternative people, many of whom can be of a genius nature. In addition, he will be very tolerant of racial, religious, sexual or other differences; there is virtually no stereotype that can prevent him from making another individual a friend. The native will have the magic ability to unite all these radically different people into a group with him as a center, furthermore promoting the breaking of borders between human beings. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAs Uranus is an unpredictable planet, many of his friends will appear suddenly in his life and their bonding will deepen rather quickly. Of course, if Uranus is ill-aspected by malefics the native will also suffer unexpected loss of friends due to various reasons. In addition, adverse aspects show friends that may have some mental issues, possibly leading to nervous breakdowns or other problems. It has to be noticed that such friends may be of a very high intelligence, which can frequently lead to schizoid behaviors and other similar issues.<br />\nThose with natal Uranus in the eleventh house are craving for freedom through friendships and do not like to feel pressured from their acquaintances. Uranus will make the individual strive to keep some distance, or at least an irregular pattern of communication. They prefer to hang out with their friends without previous planning, and under no circumstances can bond with someone who desires constant daily attention. Uranus placed here is protecting from all types of manipulation and psychic vampirism; the native is rather intuitive about with whom and when to hang out, not allowing overly attached people use them.<br />\nThis natal placement can also give friends of a rebellious nature, and when Uranus is aspecting Mars they can have even revolutionary tendencies. Hard aspects between the two planets may influence them to apply drastic changes towards society, and thus they will definitely take part in demonstrations. Usually, the combination of these two planets is having unexpected and even explosive results; this in turn can make them parts of revolutionary or anarchist plots. Such natal aspects show danger from explosions, gunpowder or mass violence, and the native should be rather careful if supporting groups that have revolt as a cause.<br />\nA well aspected Uranus in the 11th house may bring a windfall of money, usually with the help of friends and somehow connected with technology or the internet. Such a situation may happen if Uranus is positively aspected by Venus or Jupiter, with at least one planet being the ruler of the second or eighth house. A transiting planet can trigger this unexpected event, which usually happens only once in a lifetime. The nature of Uranus definitely indicates success with the aid of social media and the internet, and the whole situation can even create a social wave or trend, which in turn brings a massive income. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nUranus is one of the planets responsible for unusual or even “paranormal” phenomena, and when located in the house of friends it can bring such types of events through them. Many of the friends may be interested in astrology or the occult, while also have spiritual powers that ordinary people do not own. Such experiences may be frequently triggered by transits and can strongly influence the native, especially in terms of spiritual progress through the groups he takes part in. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIf you have this natal placement, be careful about long-term projects that you and your friends may decide to create. Uranus is definitely not a stable planet, and especially with difficult aspects it will bring chaotic movements by the participants. This does not really help a stable progress of the projects; on the other hand can lead to quantum leaps and successes – which will be also of an unexpected nature.

This eradicates the risk of working in jobs he does not like, and can eventually lead to doing a dream job. Or more precisely, creating it on his own. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe erratic nature of the planet is making the native feel uncomfortable in orthodox types of careers, which involve routine. For such people, a perfect job is something non-monotonous that can offer very strong mental stimulation. As Uranus is responsible for everything connected with technology, internet jobs are one of the best solutions so that the individual prospers.<br />\nSuch people dislike authority and will not submit easily to employers; thus a freelancer career and being self-employed is more suitable as it can grant freedom of movement. In case that the native has to work under the instructions of an employer, Uranus will definitely rebel in some moment; this will most certainly lead to quitting the job in a quite unpredictable manner. Indeed, the 10th house individual may be very hasty in such decisions; he will even quit the exact moment that this idea appears in his mind. An adversely aspected Uranus can lead to lengthy periods of unemployment or quick small jobs, as the native has a deeply buried repulsion towards applying for interviews.<br />\nIn addition, Uranus in the 10th house can bring sudden genius insights and make a person an inventor. He can literally invent his own career, even if it is not connected with electronics or technology. Uranus can make an idea suddenly appear in his mind, and dictate him to follow an occupation that is rather pioneering, unique or even weird. In any case, Uranus will bring quite a lot of career direction changes, parallel projects and alternative collaborations with eccentric people. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAs the 10th house is also ruling the individual’s stronger parental figure (usually the father), this parent may have been himself of a weird nature. The native as a child observes the parent having a rather different approach towards work than the rest of the world, and copies this pattern to reproduce it later in his life. The father may be an Aquarius or elsehow have Uranus prominently emphasized in his natal chart. He usually dislikes social climbing to authority positions, may be an altruist or a revolutionary and these traits inspire the young native, who does also becomes a non-conformist while choosing a career.<br />\nUranus rules unexpected events, and when located in the 10th house can bring sudden publicity, even if it is unwanted by the native. Usually, this happens due to some unique characteristic of the individual or his actions, and he will appear in the news or be known by the society for being an extreme paradigm. His life and career can be very interesting for other people to know, and any information about the native will be presented under the label “believe it or not”. If Uranus is adversely aspected, the publicity may bring difficulties to the person. He might feel that people make fun of his uniqueness and mock him, while also be a part of a scandal. The mass will gossip about him and he will feel pressured and uncomfortable while in the centre of attention. On the other hand, public opinion is not really something he is concerned about, so any negative effects will pass soon.<br />\nDuring some positive transit of a planet to the native’s natal Uranus, his career can take off like an airplane and reach great heights he would only dream of. Beware though, Uranus acts the same unpredictably in the opposite way too. A hard transit might even make a business empire crumble to ashes. Of course, one of the good traits that a tenth house Uranus offers is an indifference to failures (well, victories too). The native will gather the ashes and will be reborn as a phoenix eventually, provided that he still cares to create a new career and not just indulge in living. Because indeed, such people care a lot more about life itself than self-defining through what they do as a job. In extreme cases, especially when the wealth houses provide the native means to live, he may even consciously choose to not work at all. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nNatal Uranus in the 10th house is a pretty good natal placement, as the eccentric planet feels quite well in the realm of Capricorn and Saturn. After all, it is a lot better to have it high in the heavens, where it will mostly influence life directions than below the horizons. The planet’s traits can at least somehow be directed towards certain targets and goals. We should also mention that this natal placement will give to the individual quite a lot of altruistic traits, and he might battle for a better society. Uranus is ruling revolutionaries and anarchists, and the native may play his role in the social structure to promote such pioneering and transformative ideas.<br />\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:43:34'),

The 9th house is the traditional home of Sagittarius and Jupiter, so the expansive planet magnifies the eccentric character of Uranus, leading it towards an unquenchable search of cosmic truths.<br />\nPeople with this natal placement are in a strong need of freedom concerning their philosophic and religious beliefs. They will revolt quite early in their life against ideas induced by their parents and teachers, choosing unconventional ways and seeking alternate paths of spirituality. 9th house Uranus people hate dogma, and most probably will revolt even against their own ideas when they get outdated. They will probably develop quite heretic cosmic theories, and frequently be interested in astrology or the paranormal. Sociology and philosophy are also subjects they will dedicate a lot of time to, and usually get actively involved through publishing their thoughts of them. Such individuals will prefer to offer their writings for free, and use the internet as the means of publishing; do not forget that Uranus is ruling technology!<br />\nUranus is feeling quite well in the 9th house, as in most houses that are on the upper side of the natal chart. Indeed, regarding the possible erratic or even malefic behavior of this planet, it is quite better to have Uranus somewhere high in heavens as it does not become a handicap in basic life matters. If negatively aspected it will still impose difficulties, but the native will definitely be able to work on them, as they are part of the reality he experiences. On the other hand if it is near or below the horizon, its traits are appearing in the core of the native’s character or even as his reality’s stable surroundings, especially in his young years. These traits then are quite unchangeable and the native has little power over them. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nKeep in mind that Uranus in the ninth house can create geniuses; nevertheless it will definitely create problems with education. The native does not enjoy structured learning, and even with good aspects there are great possibilities of quitting university or at least delaying it. As Uranus is ruling technology, it may make the native a technological freak; in such occasions even his studies can be successful, provided that they are on subjects like informatics, mechanics, robotics and other similar ones.<br />\nThis placement gives some possibilities of an academic career in such subjects, but the unpredictable nature of Uranus also signifies a tendency to quitting in order to get concentrated on something different. The planet does not guarantee stability by any means! In case that the individual chooses the road of becoming a teacher, he will use quite unconventional ways of holding lessons, giving a different approach and insight to his students. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nA well aspected Uranus may make the native have a vision of a perfect altruistic society. He will be quite interested in new forms of social auto-organization, and will become a pioneer in social reforms. His way of life will follow the romantic ideas and insights that appear as new patterns in his mind, and he will influence a lot of other people towards receiving them and experimenting on them. 9th house Uranus people are striving to create their Utopia; this might be an unattainable goal but definitely is a small step into collectively marching forward towards a new era.<br />\nAs the 9th house is ruling travels and foreign places, Uranus can bring unexpected journeys to faraway places. These will be of a quite eccentric nature, appear suddenly and if the planet is badly aspected will not turn out well. People with such a natal Uranus should be very careful in exotic countries, especially if the planet is adversely aspected by Mars, Saturn or Pluto. They should stay away from all types of massive demonstrations and avoid countries with political turbulence. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThink wisely before choosing the country you travel, no matter how much exotic it sounds, and take all the necessary precautions. As Uranus will probably urge you to travel suddenly, make sure you at least learn the current situation of the country you visit, possible vaccinations that you must do and other important details. Generally, a lot of minor or major disturbances can occur. Usual problems that Uranus brings while placed in the 9th is an outdated passport or loss of it, arriving late in the airport and all types of bad luck events.<br />\nPeople with natal Uranus placed in the 9th can be very radical in their perception of reality, with their innovative ideas being even destructive. With good aspects, Uranus externalizes its positive traits that will help the native progress; on the other hand negative ones may give him a nihilistic approach towards reality, making him more concerned in demolishing patterns but without alternative propositions for them.<br />\nHard aspects can even create a violent revolutionary without a reason; a person who will fight traditionalism even if it is of a positive nature. People with such adverse aspects can pose a threat to the society, as they will try to enforce a change that only destroys and does not provide an alternative for progress. In extreme cases, the native rejects all types of spirituality and social structures, becomes an aggressive atheist and anarchist and may harm the society instead of aiding its enlightment.<br />\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:43:41'),
(1520, 0, 'us', 'uranus-in-8th-house', 5, '<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\nHaving natal Uranus in the 8th house is a rather good placement, which totally complies with the tendencies of our aeon. The 8th house is an open gate to the other worlds, and the presence of Uranus is a very strong indicator of powers that still cannot be explained. The erratic character of Uranus might bring some issues in the everyday reality of a person; nevertheless material things are no priority to such a native.<br />\nThe 8th house is widely known to be the house of death, and Uranus placed inside it is giving a sudden and unusual death without suffering. This by no means implies an early death, but quite much erases possibilities of leaving this world due to sickness or other lengthy processes. In case that Mars is aspecting natal Uranus, this might happen through an accident. In addition, Uranus is responsible for all weird deaths that can even become news on the television. Curiously enough, it is also ruling funny ways of death, and everything else that falls in the category “believe it or not”. Yes, if you have this placement, be careful of stepping on banana skins or choke on your own saliva. Yes, being struck by a lightning or electricity is also a matter of this placement.<br />\nAs the 8th house is linked to inheritances, this natal placement gives quite a lot of possibilities to receive an unexpected legacy. If the planet is well-aspected, this is definite to happen and the native will generally receive a lot of financial help through other people, even without doing anything to get it! His finances might change drastically, and become a wealthy person in just one day, after a long period of poverty. Be careful, because the nature of Uranus might also do the exact opposite. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWhen the planet is ill-aspected, it gives high possibility of bankruptcy, with the government or banks confiscating the native’s wealth. Again, such types of events will be unpredictable and will strike like a bolt out of the blue. Even if a bankruptcy happens, do not get disheartened; Uranus might gift back the same way it takes something away from someone. A good characteristic of such types of people is that they do not really care about wealth, so ups and downs of their finances are regarded with a pinch of salt.<br />\nThe rebellious planet Uranus seeks freedom in the matters of any house it is located in. When placed in the 8th, the native will seek freedom through sexuality. People with such a placement do not have taboos and adore engaging in breaking the taboos with their partners. Uranus in the 8th can give a deep need of sexual experimentation, creating a lot of fetishes and perversions. The native’s sexual encounters are surrounded by altruism; the individual loves to offer to his partner and can reach higher spiritual levels with someone he unites. Sex becomes sacred, and even magical. People with this natal position of Uranus might be interested in Tantra, Yoga or various systems of such types. These can include energy manipulation through sexual arousal, but such a thing is not necessary. There are a lot more ways to raise energy, without the need of it to be sexual.<br />\nAs we speak about magic, we should not forget to mention the occult abilities of such an individual. Uranus may grant him with a very strong intuition, which is usually arriving as a lightning strike. These types of insights can create sudden clarity moments and even bring clairvoyance. The person can instantly “download” cosmic information, and psychically even be in more than one place at the same time. This natal aspect helps with astral projection and common techniques; the native’s veil towards the unknown is rather thin and he can learn how to lift it without a lot of difficulties. The other realms are strongly attracting a person with Uranus in the 8th house, and he will be very interested in researching the possibilities of life after death. A lot of people with this placement will believe in reincarnation, or some other form of life/soul continuation after the physical death of the body. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nUranus in the eighth gives a natural hate towards banks and the financial system. The person might not care about paying his taxes and generally will dislike being in any type of connection with such institutions. This placement is typical for people that use alternative ways to handle their finances. They prefer electronic numismatics, such as the Bitcoin. Also, they will choose to trade services with someone rather than pay or get paid. Generally, a good aspected Uranus may indicate great gains generated through the internet, while also donations through it. This placement can guarantee a success in crowd-funding or elsehow raising money for a start-up company. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThis placement is a rather good for Uranus; he feels quite free in this Scorpio/Pluto house. Due to the fact that the 8th house is an open gate towards… the infinite, Uranus enjoys the nonexistence of borders. Thus, he can operate rebelliously without being repressed by any type of restrictions. Except of course for a physical death; but is there anyone who will not pass this gate?<br />\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:43:45'),
(1521, 0, 'us', 'uranus-in-7th-house', 5, '<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\nNatal Uranus in the 7th house of a native’s chart will definitely bring a lot of turbulence in all matters connected with marriage, business partnerships and other forms of unification. The 7th house is traditionally ruled by Libra and Venus; therefore the erratic planet of Uranus brings discord and unexpected events that do not blend harmonically with the gentle energies that the house bears.<br />\nUranus is making the native have a strong need of freedom; this can frequently manifest as a tendency to not get married if the person is conscious enough of his needs. The native might realize through his relationships that his privacy and freedom of actions are an important priority, and establish more open patterns of partnerships with his significant others. This natal aspect can give open relationships or other unorthodox types of bonds. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless, Uranus in the 7th house does not imply that the native will not get married. Actually, few people reach such a conscious stance early in their lives, and this placement gives strong possibilities of hasty decisions concerning 7th house matters. This could lead to an unexpected marriage early in life, without knowing well and long enough the spouse. Such a unification will most probably end as suddenly as it started; Uranus not only brings an unexpected wedding but also a divorce. In many occasions, this experience is actually the lesson for the native to understand himself and his needs; he gains wisdom about what he wants in his life by understanding that he cannot function in a stable marital environment. In addition, Uranus placed here will have a large impact on the possible wedding ceremony. There might actually not be one! Uranus is the planet that could bring a quick wedding in a casino chapel in Las Vegas, or make the wedding ring be made of plastic!<br />\nSo, does Uranus in the 7th house make a stable marriage impossible? No, the planet’s eccentric character goes even beyond that stereotype! In case that Uranus is well aspected in this placement, this indicates a happy marriage soaked in non-conformism. It will bring a partner who can be a genius or a weirdo, and if the couple does not adapt to certain patterns that the society imposes then it can grant a wonderful marital life. The significant other may have heavy Aquarius/Uranus emphasis, or Uranus residing in the 1st house, and if they both abandon the traditional views of commitment then their relationship will be of a unique nature. They will function as friends and not only as lovers, be very altruistic or even have a long-distance relationship where each one will also preserve his personal life and respect the other’s privacy. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nOn the other hand, if Uranus has hard aspects with planets, the individual will eventually discover that he is trapped in a situation he does not enjoy. Even if he loves his partner, the everyday reality is killing the initial magic and creates frustration. The native will most probably erupt suddenly and run away. Actually, the quicker he does it, the better it will be for both; there are even possibilities of saving their partnership- as the native may not have a problem with his spouse but rather with the routine that such a life gives. Indeed, if the basis of such a relationship changes, there are great possibilities of a reunification; of course with different rules this time (or even no rules at all!). Keep in mind that people with their natal Uranus in the 7th house dislike drama; this can actually be a reason for them to run away so do not indulge in it if you do not want to lose them.<br />\nExactly the same patterns apply in business partnerships. Uranus will definitely not provide any type of stability, and the partners will have a lot of erratic behaviors. Their unpredictable character will not help the business to blossom, and the overall partnership could end up in a court.<br />\nFinally, this natal placement of Uranus is not favorable for legal affairs. There might be problems concerning trials, and losses through them. The native should avoid being in a public position as Uranus will bring scandals and lawsuits, which he will probably lose and have his public image destroyed. This could happen even if the native is honest; heavy aspects of Uranus here indicate victimization- the open enemies or partners of the native might use him as a scapegoat for covering their own dirty business. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:43:49'),
(1522, 0, 'us', 'uranus-in-5th-house', 5, '<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\nAs Uranus is the most unconventional planet, his presence in the 5th house of a native will bring a rather eccentric approach towards the areas ruled by the house. The unstable and unpredictable character of Uranus will bring a lot of sudden changes, whose nature is mostly dependant on the aspects other planets make to Uranus.<br />\nThe 5th house is ruling love, flirting and casual sex. Thus, Uranus will bring a rather chaotic love life, with many partners and unexpected events. The people who have this placement will experience tremendously strong love-at-first-sight relationships, as the nature of the planet is to make things escalate rather quickly. Nevertheless, this is a double edged knife, as the planet can make an affair end the same quickly as it starts, even without any apparent reason. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nUsually, with this natal placement the native is not very fond of emotional bonds and will be the one giving end to a relationship. This rushing out will be like a bolt out of the blue, so they be very careful about how you handle the partner’s psychology. In case that one has this placement and discovers this pattern of jumping in and out of relationships chaotically, the best thing is to not define their affairs as stable relationships from the beginning, so as not to break the other person’s heart. Of course, if Uranus has very difficult aspects with other planets, one may experience a rather discordant love life with many abrupt endings, drama and extreme situations. The eccentric character of his partners might bring a lot of problems even after the break up, and the break ups can create a general havoc. The usual reason for such a native’s escape from a relationship are feelings of constriction; he is not able to feel repressed and rebels against this regime, even if it exists only in his head. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nUranus in the 5th house can create musicians- mostly of some alternative type of music. In addition, as Uranus is responsible of technology, this natal placement can create DJ’s or music composers that use a computer. Their music and behavior on stage is very creative and original. Of course, not all people with this placement do become artists of some kind; aspects to Uranus from Venus, Neptune and the two lights are empowering the possibilities though.<br />\nConcerning gambling, which is also ruled by the 5th house, this placement gives possibilities of big gains and losses. Everything depends on the aspects of the other planets; if Uranus is well aspected then there are possibilities of big and unexpected gains. This is even more prominent if the second house cusp falls in Aquarius, or Uranus receives trines and sextiles from Venus or Jupiter. If you have a 2nd house Venus or Jupiter trining your natal Uranus, you should definitely gamble once in a while. Even if you buy a very cheap lottery, there are great possibilities of gaining a windfall of money with this placement. Try that, especially during transits of these three planets through the exact natal locations of any of these planets. Then, the gates of luck open! <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIf you have Uranus in the 5th house, be very careful in your sexual encounters as this placement gives possibilities of unexpected pregnancies. Even when you are in a stable relationship, the pregnancy might come in a period that you would least expect so always use contraception in case you do not feel ready for this responsibility. If Uranus is adversely aspected by Mars or some other malefic, there are some chances of a miscarriage or an abortion. On the other hand, if a child is born it will be of a rather eccentric nature, even possibly a genius. Uranus will make it be very interested in technology from its early years, and you should regard it as an equal human being to you. The child might possess a wisdom and insight that rarely children have, and thus this will complicate its character. To help it bloom in a harmonic way do not pressure it; be that kind of a parent that listens to it and interacts a lot, giving it a lot of choices from its early years. Give it some freedom and be friends; this is the best way to allow his Uranian energies to function well.<br />\nThe 5th house is all about fun and games, so the presence of the ruler of technology will make someone be a gamer. These individuals will probably continue playing games on their PC or console during all their life, as such types of recreation give them a lot of joy. This, combined to the great sense of humor the native usually has, makes him a great company for online games and all type of activities that involve technology. Yes, even sexual.

(1523, 0, 'us', 'uranus-in-3rd-house', 5, '<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\nUranus placed in the 3rd house of a natal chart will create a person with an unusual way of thought. The mind of the native is working in a different way than the mass; this differentiation can create both the genius and the madman, the pioneer and the socially alienated weirdo. In any case, such kind of people are making humanity progress, as they are receptors of thought patterns which the mass cannot still reach in the collective unconscious. And beware, today’s madman might be recognized as a genius some day, and today’s genius might be a madman who can control his reactions.<br />\nThis placement gives an original way of thinking, and the native will frequently have moments when innovative ideas will suddenly appear in his mind. His school years might have been difficult, as he may have been considered weird by the other children. He will probably change schools, thus alienating from friends and feeling unsafe in new school surroundings. In any case, school is for him a restriction and he feels a strong urge to break free from its bonds. The moment of finishing school is a huge liberation for his mind. He tends to develop a weird handwriting pattern, or some rather unique way of speaking. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nUranus in the 3rd house can give separation with the native’s siblings; the planet is ruling unexpected events and this can happen as a bolt out of the blue. Generally, the native’s siblings can also have a genius mind, while if Uranus is very adversely afflicted they can have mental problems. Their siblings will usually have Uranian emphasis in their natal chart, or be of Aquarius sign. The same rule can apply to the native’s neighbors, who will be of a rather eccentric nature. This is quite fine and even interesting, and the person can learn a lot through hanging out with them. Of course, when their natal Uranus has destructive aspects from Pluto, Saturn or Mars they should be careful of how they handle their neighbors as they might develop crazy and impulsive reactions. It is not the best thing to have a totally crazy neighbor communicating with you every day and invading your privacy and reality.<br />\nPeople with such a placement are usually fun to hang out with, and they will many times experience unbelievable situations, about which they will be speaking to others for long. Indeed, what Uranus brings cannot be easily believed, but these people have their antennas rather open towards the outer realms. A lot of mysterious things might appear to them; from automatic writing to voices in their head or prophetic dreams. Someone might say that these things are just evidence of mental disorders, but what if the prophetic dream comes true, the voice in the head will whisper a new scientific invention and the automatic writing will create a give answers to important questions? <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWhen Uranus is located in the 3rd house the individual may be very interested with astrology, the paranormal and other areas of spirituality. The third house is responsible for reading and writing, so the native will at least become a frequent reader of books, blogs and forums connected with the supernatural realms. If there is a connection between his natal Uranus and the 9th house, there are big possibilities that he will publish works on these subjects. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThis placement makes the native express himself in unusual ways. The third house is also ruling everything that is crafted by hand, and the presence of the planet can make someone a good painter, sculptor or artist. If Uranus is conjuncting Venus in the third house, then the native’s creations can be categorized as wonders. In any case, their art can be defined as original and eccentric, while futurism and asymmetry can frequently be an ingredient of their style. Such artists can also excel in inventive projects where art mixes with machinery and mechanisms, while also use physical phenomena, magnetism or lights in their creations.<br />\nThey will have some rather chaotic journeys during their life. These short trips can be connected to moments of crisis or escapism tendencies, but after each journey the native will return regenerated and more powerful. These travels will usually start unexpectedly and also contain profane life-changing experiences. The whole pattern of the journey might seem that something higher invited the person to visit the area, so as the weird phenomenon takes place in front of the native’s eyes. The next time you listen such a person speak about his weird experiences, better carefully listen than mock, for Uranus is the ruler of the new era and everyone who he speaks to is his prophet.<br />\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:43:57'),
(1524, 0, 'us', 'uranus-in-2nd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen the eccentric planet of Uranus is positioned in the second house, its unconventional behavior affects all financial matters of the native. Being the most unpredictable planet, Uranus does not grant a stable pattern of income and expenses. This does not mean living in poverty, but rather having an unusual approach towards money and belonging. The native’s soul regards money and bills as walls limiting his freedom, as unwanted responsibilities that just distract from the real targets of life.\nA second house Uranus person will usually have unique methods of earning money. They can earn through technology and electronics, while also in extreme situations through genius inventions and design of gadgets. A lot of people with this aspect are occupied in programming professions, and their mind is great for informatics technology. Second house Uranus individuals have a great talent in advertising and all innovative ideas. \n \n\n\nInnovative technology will be one of the native’s biggest expenses too. He will be of the first that buy a pioneering device or new software, as they thoroughly observe the progress in technology. This behavior makes them be always ahead of all the other people in this area, giving them the ability to expertise more quickly in such subjects. In case that Uranus is aspected with a planet in the 9th house, they might be writing about the usage of technology or teaching other people about it. Their income can be connected with high-tech websites or blogs.\nUranus in the second house tends to give unsettled finances. The planet’s eruptive behavior gives unexpected earnings and expenses. The native might be used to a rather minimal life, without luxury, and even when getting rich not changing his attitude towards wealth. There will be a tendency to buy odd and eccentric things, and this might even affect the interior decoration of one’s home. Such natives are strongly drawn towards asymmetry. In any case, money is never something important for them, being for them just a necessary tool for moving in their reality. If Uranus is forming a trine with Venus or Jupiter located in the 5th house, the aspect is ideal for gambling, lucky games, stock exchange and speculation. The unpredictable nature of Uranus might gift huge amounts of wealth in the least expected moment. \n \n\n\nIn case that Uranus is adversely aspected by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native’s finances will constantly pass critical situations. Unexpected expenses will frequently occur, and there will be difficulties in creating a stable pattern in issues of the second house. Especially when Mars is involved, the person can get robbed or otherwise violently lose what he has earned. Also, his earnings are in danger of some fraudulent behavior by his employer, business partner or co-workers, depending on if the 6th, the 7th or the 10th house is somehow involved in the situation. \n \n\n\nFor some individuals with Uranus in the second house, the risk of living a bohemian life is very appealing. They can enjoy in chaotic financial situations, as the air of freedom blowing around them is making them feel totally alive. This aspect can even create vagabonds or conscious homeless, without having a real reason of becoming one. This could be an act of rebellion against the financial system, but the roots lay deep in the childhood and the native’s upbringing. His parents and nearby surroundings did not define well the nature of belongings to the child, which in turn can bring an extreme behavior of detachment from financial goods. The person might even become rich, but choose to live like a homeless. Each native with such a placement acts in a uniquely different way, and cannot get categorized. Uranus does not create similar massive patterns, and makes each individual’s life story a unique paradigm. A curious fact is that even their possible dramatic bankruptcies can be secretly scheduled, as a symbolic act of liberation from the ties of society.

They can become pioneers of great changes, and when assisted by other aspects they can have genius minds. Such individuals have usually turbulent lives full of unexpected events, and are strongly interested in technology. \n \n\n\nThey have a natural curiosity about the progress in computers and electronics, and simply love getting involved with every new gadget that is produced. Many of them will get a lot deeper in gadgets; they will not only learn how to use them but also to repair them. For them, the way that electricity, data and the internet function is of the most interesting things that exist.\nUranus in the first house usually gives a tall and clumsy figure. There might be a funny way of walking, or some other notable difference from the usual body functions; yet these individuals cannot be considered unattractive. Something in their body might be uneven or asymmetrical; yet the curious fact is that this asymmetry might be of the most attractive things on them. Their clumsiness can bring them accidents, and when Uranus is adversely aspected they can be unlucky through unexpected events. When a transiting planet forms a difficult aspect to their natal Uranus, there can be whole periods of bad luck. Of course, the opposite can happen too; when the aspects are good they might observe periods of devilish luck, synchronicities and series of positive events that would simply not happen to another person.\nSuch natives appear eccentric to the masses, and this is usually amplified by the weird style and clothing that they choose for their appearance.  Most of the times, the reason behind such a personal style is their conscious resistance to fashion and stereotypes. A first house Uranus living in a conservative society would have an extreme appearance; while when living in a society where the extreme is the natural he would choose to dress himself simple and conservatively. He does not care so much about putting taste in how he looks like; unless of course his natal Uranus is somehow connected with Venus.\nIndividuals with such a placement are rather aggressive, and can have outbursts of anger when pressured or feeling jailed. They adore shocking the world around them; demolishing taboos and revolting is for them a hobby that even brings joy. They are drawn to the paranormal, and many of them either believe or research Astrology, the Occult and other schools of spiritual thought. \n \n\n\nThey care about the society and are frequently very altruistic. Their revolutionary character can lead them into politics; usually towards groups and parties that are against the system. Such a placement of Uranus creates the activist, and there are high possibilities of joining life-long causes in order to change the society. A first house Uranus should be careful not to become overly fanatic; there is a thin line between fighting for a change and getting into violent behaviors only for the sake of letting your inner anger explode. \n \n\n\nFirst house Uranus natives adore company and fun; socializing in groups is of their favorite things in life. Deep inside them, there might be a hidden solitude, as they know that their radical differences from all the others create barriers. Nevertheless, we are entering the epoch of Aquarius and the whole humanity is obtaining Uranian characteristics.

Indeed, his urge for freedom does not comply with the nature of the house, which is work and service towards others. Also, the 6thhouse is highly responsible for health issues, and Uranus usually brings unexpected troubles concerning the native’s body, mostly if it is adversely aspected.\nThe sixth house is responsible on work and service and having planets inside it can be rather unfortunate. If he is an owner of a company, his servants might be better than him in his job, while their actions towards him are uncontrolled and they tend to end up running his business however they want. The curious thing is that in the end this might bring financial gains to him, but at the same time will definitely hurt his ego. \n \n\n\nIn case he serves other people, the native’s attitude towards his work is rather rebellious and he feels his job being some kind of imprisonment, from which he yearns to escape. This can frequently manifest in reality and the native will quit jobs, but more problems can arise because his rapid decisions have not planned the next step, resulting in periods of unemployment. The best way to work is with flexible schedule that gives him a lot of independence and freedom, both in his work schedule and his decisions. A great way is to work through the internet, as Uranus is ruling technology and offers him the necessary distance from co-workers, while also he can schedule his time in a preferable way.\nIn case that Uranus is positively aspected, working through the internet or otherwise getting involved in technological jobs is a great decision for the native. Other jobs that should go well are those concerning electricity and mechanics. Inventing new types of jobs could also go quite well; Uranus likes discoveries and likes to offer genius ideas from out of the blue. A person with Uranus in the 6th house can become a great inventor, when Uranus is positively aspected by Venus, Jupiter and other planets. On the other hand, this does not guarantee success; such type of inventors usually stay unknown unless there are planets in the 10th house making positive aspects to Uranus and other astrological points that signify fame. One should have in mind, however, that adverse aspects could bring accidents, and the native who has them is advised not to work with electricity or machinery as this could severely harm his health. The worst indicators are squares, oppositions and conjunctions of Uranus with Mars, Saturn and Pluto.\nThe presence of Uranus in the sixth house can bring unexpected diseases, which are mostly connected with the nervous system or mental health. During the early years of the native, the placement could signify a lot of stress due to excessive hard work, which can manifest as nervous breakdowns or other psycho-somatic diseases. It depends on the sign in which the cusp of the house lays; Aries brings problems of the head, Scorpio brings unexpected issues with the reproduction system and so on. There is high possibility of stroke or other nervous diseases in the latter stages of life. Parkinson, Alzheimer or other mental debilitation issues could also appear. Search for squares, oppositions or conjunctions with Mercury in the natal chart; if they exist then you are in a danger group. Also, Uranus being located in Gemini or Virgo makes you vulnerable to such kind of health problems. \n \n\n\nThe native must be careful with his health and frequently examine his body, as Uranus does is responsible for sudden changes and not chronic diseases. The best thing he can do is keep his body in a generally good condition, in order to overcome any possible disease quickly. The most important thing they should do is concentrate on living a carefree life, as it is his worries that are responsible about such kind of diseases. Focusing on general well-being will diminish any effects that these sudden health issues will have.\nThe sixth house also refers to small animals, and the native should be careful as there might appear difficult situations concerning bites or diseases passing to him from them. In addition, he should not involve in farming and breeding of animals, as his business will be unsuccessful and there is possibility of great losses. \n \n\n\nA good way to trigger the positive traits of Uranus in the 6th house, is altruism and service towards individuals and the humanity. When the individual is involved in volunteering for good causes, when he offers to the community without waiting something in return, the negative traits of Uranus are diminishing, thus having also an impact on the body and possible health issues. Also, all types of meditation, yoga and other spiritual exercises are calming down the nervousness that Uranus brings, and keep the body balanced, preventing possible mental diseases to appear. The native has to find ways to calm himself and abolish his worries, and this can frequently come through dedicating time to nature. Indeed, his frequent involvement with technology is accumulating explosive energy in his natal Uranus, and passing time in nature away from anything technological can heal him. \n \n\n\nWomen with such a placement should be rather careful, when Uranus is also squaring their Moon. The nervousness that derives from their job can influence their period cycle and create problems with its stability, while also induce hysterical outbursts. Generally, all natives that have such a placement should reconsider their priorities and understand that their job is not the most important thing in their life, and that a healthy body and soul is much more important. Maybe it is indeed a burden to carry such a placement through all your life, but there are conscious options of empowering the good parts of it. And when Uranus is allowed by us to function properly, he just can bring positive change. It is the resistance we impose to change, that make this eccentric planet malfunction in our chart, and make us pass through troubles.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:47:31'),
(1527, 0, 'us', 'uranus-in-4th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nUranus is the most unpredictable planet, responsible for sudden events and change. When located in the 4th house, which is responsible for one’s roots, family, childhood and residence, it usually signifies unstable conditions concerning these matters. \n \n\n\nUranus is also the planet of technology, and when someone has it in the 4th house it indicates that a lot of investments will be made in new technology for his home. He would be the first to buy the 3D TV, the first to connect the fridge with his computer, and it is highly likely that he would dedicate his own effort in renovating the whole place. Also, the unstable character of Uranus makes the native change decorations and characteristics of his personal space frequently, he gets bored easily and needs a new environment to feel good.\nAnother possibility is of having an unusual family structure, as close friends or other relatives of the parents can be living in the same house with them, thus creating a weird situation where the child observes more people being a parental figure for them. The residence is unlikely to be a healthy environment for a child to grow, and this is what pushes the native to subconsciously change a lot of residence places in his mature life. He usually departs early for his new beginning, but changing places of living can become a habit exercised even when the surroundings are pleasant. The native needs to be constantly on the move. Also, a 4th house Uranian is highly unlikely to succeed in a predetermined road by his parents – he chooses radically different career options and general life approach.\nA native with such a placement has a lot of residence changes, and separations from his roots are very usual. This could be a divorce of his parents, a need to relocate due to external reasons, and even to flee to another place due to wars, natural catastrophes or other unpredictable events.  In case that there is separation from a parent, the most usual is that the mother is the one who leaves. She often is either an Aquarius, or has a lot of planets in this sign. Also, she may have very adversely aspected Uranus, which always gives a tendency to the native for fleeing from a situation. The more close Uranus is to the cusp of the 4th house, the more deep in his childhood this events are to have happened. In addition, neurological problems could be an issue of the family break-up, as Uranus is responsible for mental issues, especially when the Moon is present adversely. \n \n\n\nIn case that Uranus is well aspected, the situation is quite different. The paradoxical planet can even bring a lot of benefits, as it can signify a rather different way of childhood years. One or both parents could be eccentric in a good way; this placement can signify a native born from hippie parents or other unconditional characters that do not follow the general rules of the society. With such a personal family background, it is natural that the child will also develop a different view both towards life and towards domestic atmosphere, resulting in similar patterns when he creates his own family. In case that Uranus is well aspected by Jupiter, the childhood could be so magical that the chart owner is blessed with a life outside the borders that usual children have constructed by their parents. \n \n\n\nUranus has a lot to do with the paranormal and occult, so such a native can develop such kind of interests later in his life. Because the 4th house is responsible for one’s roots, it is possible that some kind of blessing or ability comes from his ancestors. In case there is a conjunction of Uranus with the Sun, one should receive it through his father’s lineage, in case there is a conjunction with the Moon, through his mothers’.\nThis placement brings aversion to property ownership, and the native consciously has an attitude against it. He would always choose to have a good atmosphere in his surroundings, not caring so much either about the financial considerations or about the condition of the residence. It is how he feels inside there, that makes him choose where to live. And, even if he finds the best choice, the most natural thing is that he will  not stay there constantly. Uranus in 4th house can even make someone having an own apartment, but preferring to sleep at other places; in extreme situations he can become a nomad and enjoy a life on the move as a traveler. This aspect by no means should be considered negative in advance, as in the end it could even lead to a life full of happiness. In case that such kind of people stayed in their own place, they would remain unhappy and would never reach their potential. After all, such natives are never too much connected to the terms “country”, “homeland” and they do not lose something by living those behind.\nThe chaotic attitude can be a stepping stone for discovering the native’s real self, and the best thing when Uranus issues rise is to just follow the instincts and flow with the reality. After all, Uranian changes cannot be avoided as they are mostly external, so the best way is to re-adapt to the new surroundings; in the end the results might bring a lot better reality than the one which was crushed down before.\nNatives with heavily afflicted Uranus should be always careful for neurological and mental problems. When Uranus is in the 4th house, this means that these health issues can be inherited from one of the parents. The best thing such a native can do is to monitor himself frequently , for there is a pattern of reappearance of these diseases to the children. Of course, these are mostly triggered by heavy transits from other planets, and might not be at all triggered in one’s lifetime. The most probable is that Uranus will just have an influence on one’s nerves and temper. Search for the location of Mercury and Moon; if there are no squares, oppositions and conjunctions to Uranus, the most likely is that no mental disease is ever to occur. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:47:38'),
(1528, 0, 'us', 'chiron-in-11th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Chiron in the 11th house of a natal chart indicates some emotional wounds connected with the native’s friendships and loneliness. The eleventh house rules friends, groups and organizations; thus the asteroid’s presence here shows unresolved traumas related to the house’s matters. Chiron in the eleventh house can also signify an early disappointment in childhood concerning group activities, as the native may have felt rejected by children communities. \n \n\n\nGenerally, asteroid Chiron is responsible for traumas and their healing; thus the house where it is placed is a rather sensitive area of the native’s life. In case that the asteroid is negatively aspected, especially by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native may have experienced quite a lot of suffering. On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in the respective life area, as the native has learnt quite a lot from his own experiences.\nChiron in the house of friends may make the chart owner feel an alien when in groups of people. This placement can make him shy while being around others, and unable to express his thoughts and feelings. The chart owner has a subconscious fear of not being accepted, or even ridiculed. He feels that his thought frequencies cannot synchronize with the other group members. Misunderstandings can arise, and even if he is accepted in a group, he will always feel the outsider. This behavior can trace back to childhood years, when other children may have left him outside of organized events, or even bullied him. Such a chart owner feels quite better when his friendships are not structured in groups but sees every person individually.\nThe chart owner may have been abandoned by friends, which will induce fears about making new friendships. He will get constantly stressed, worrying that his friends might abandon him again. In extreme cases where Chiron has bad aspects, his friends may even have stabbed him in the back, using him for their purposes and then harming him. This natal placement is typical of chart owners who have become victims of bio-vampires, or of other types of individuals that take advantage of people. Sometimes, Chiron in the 11th house can even indicate that the native willingly suffers martyrdom by friends, sacrificing himself and in the end getting victimized. An 11th house Chiron person may have visions of a better society where groups function in a healthy way, and trying hard to be good for friends, yet receiving the opposite from them.\nThe 11th house also rules ones wishes and dreams about the future, and Chiron’s presence has an adverse effect on them. As the native’s dreams may be frequently shattered, he can be afraid to wish new things for the future. If you have this placement, do not get discouraged though. Maybe reality does not allow you to fly away towards your wishes as you would want to, yet there is a reason behind that. Your wishes were actually induced by Chiron’s presence in the house, and thus they are nothing more than the urge to heal its wounds. So, instead of daydreaming about things that would indirectly heal Chiron’s wounds, try to understand the nature of these traumas and work on them consciously. You will then realize that even your life wishes will change! \n \n\n\nWhen becoming a friend with someone, always question yourself whether you really like him or that person is just covering your social needs. Chiron in the 11th house can bring to the native desperate choices concerning friends. Do not let this happen, even if loneliness is an issue for you. It is better to have less friends, than have bad friends. In addition, when you enter social groups, doublecheck the quality of its members. Usually, 11th house problems are rooted in the groups of people that you choose, and not in your own self! IT is absurd to complain about being rejected or mistreated by a group, when you yourself can see that the members have bad characteristics. Unless, of course, you have a dream to become exactly as them. \n \n\n\nCuriously enough, this natal placement is quite good for people who work with group therapy. Chiron may gift them with great abilities of healing individuals, heighten the quality of a group and empower its member’s dreams. Having experienced disappointments himself, the native knows how to aid others to establish balance in such social structures. An11th house Chiron person can become a good psychologist, mostly in the field of group counseling.  This can be also very helpful in jobs connected with HR. Even if his own life does not correspond to the advice he gives, he can offer very helpful tips, based on their own problematic patterns.\nIf you have this placement, we strongly advise you to examine the natal aspects of Chiron so that you understand the whole big picture.

(1529, 0, 'us', 'chiron-in-10th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Chiron in the 10th house of a natal chart indicates some emotional wounds connected with how the native perceives his reputation, and how he feels in front of the eyes of others. The tenth house rules career and authority, while also the fame one person carries. Chiron’s presence here shows unresolved traumas created by the mostly dominant parent (usually the father), while also by any other type of authority. \n \n\n\nGenerally, asteroid Chiron is responsible for traumas and their healing; thus the house where it is placed is a rather sensitive area of the native’s life. In case that the asteroid is negatively aspected, especially by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native may have experienced quite a lot of suffering. On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in the respective life area, as the native has learnt quite a lot from his own experiences. His placement in the tenth house is of the most difficult a person can have, mostly because his wounds and fears are visible to the people around him.\nThe strongest trauma that this placement can create is rejection by the father – or the parent which has more authority in the family. That parent may be constantly making the chart owner feel unworthy and insecure, no matter how much the young native strives to become accepted. The part that can mostly hurt, is that the parent will frequently diminish the child in front of the eyes of other people. Thus, public humiliation can create a disastrous archetype in the youngster’s subconscious, which will take a lot of effort to heal. Curiously enough, such a young native does not usually rebel but accept the parent’s opinion as something correct, convincing his own self about his unworthiness.\nChiron in the house of our career can create obstacles in understanding what would be our dream job. A 10th house Chiron person may be afraid to follow his dreams, or generally believing that failure is the only possible outcome. On the other hand, as Chiron is the healer asteroid, he may guarantee success in all jobs connected with healing. Such a native can excel in careers at medical institutions or as public advisors. They have the ability to heal the masses, and pass through television or other public media great advice concerning healing. With a well aspected Chiron, one can even become a very famous healer. Even if his own career life does not correspond to the advice he gives, he can offer very helpful tips to other people. Usually, such natives are the best for becoming life coaches through developing strategic patterns that can be used in one’s job surroundings. \n \n\n\nPeople who have Chiron in the 10th can also be afraid of governmental institutions and the authority that they exercise towards people. As children, they might have felt traumatized by law enforcement. This does not mean that force was used towards them, but some dramatic event might have happened in front of their eyes. Since then, their deeper subconscious layers are creating anxiety concerning possible clashes with governmental institutions in the future. Such a person will be more stressed than others when encountering a policeman, and generally his body will be alert even if no apparent reason exists. \n \n\n\nA typical outcome for a 10th house Chiron is to create a late bloomer. People with this placement will tend to find their place in the social system later than the average person. Yet, this might be even a blessing, as they will not rush to create a career which is not suitable. Even the idea of working might be repellant for the chart owner, so he might study as long as possible, or generally try to hide away from his responsibilities towards himself. In some extreme cases where Chiron is conjuncting Mars or Uranus, the person might be running away from having a career during all his life.\nThe best way to make Chiron function in a good way when in the 10th house, is empower your Saturnine traits. Let your emotional parts aside and concentrate on whatever Saturn and Capricorn are dictating. The best remedy for the ringed planet is hard work and cold blood. You must make your skin thicker, and teach yourself to not take other people’s negative comments seriously. Becoming a workaholic will eventually make you progress so much that you will achieve your goals even if you are an underdog. A small magic trick that Saturn will like you to do, is not only become more serious but even look so. Prefer dark or black colors of clothes, conservative styles and generally try to appear professional. Saturn loves modesty, minimalism and all that signifies seriousness.\nIf you have this placement, we strongly advise you to examine the natal aspects of Chiron so that you understand the whole big picture.

(1530, 0, 'us', 'chiron-in-9th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Chiron in the 9th house of a natal chart indicates some emotional wounds connected with education, higher knowledge or even religion. As the 9th house is the realm of Jupiter, such a placement can create pain concerning expansion through new ideas. The ninth house rules religion, foreign languages and new ideas.\nGenerally, asteroid Chiron is responsible for traumas and their healing; thus the house where it is placed is a rather sensitive area of the native’s life. In case that the asteroid is negatively aspected, especially by malefics such as Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native may have experienced quite a lot of suffering through those wounds. On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in such matters, as the native has learnt quite a lot from his own experiences.\nA person with his Chiron placed in the 9th house might have experienced childhood fears concerning whatever is alien and new. The native probably were afraid of travelling far, of foreigners around him or felt uncomfortable while observing traditions that are different of his own. Many 9th house Chiron people are either stuck during all their childhood in their birthplace, which makes it difficult for them to adjust to new ways of life. Alternatively, some have experienced feeling awkward during long trips they made with their parents during their early years.\nAs the 9th house is ruling one’s higher education, the native may experience problems in his university or other higher studies. There might be an inner fear of failing, or his studies might bring him large amounts of stress and pressure. The chart owner can have bad relations with professors, or even be ridiculed in class. Sometimes, attending lessons can fell a burden. Of course, if Chiron is well-aspected, one should not expect such harsh effects. \n \n\n\nIn case that Chiron adversely aspects natal Mercury, the native might have difficulties in perceiving abstract ideas, and must try harder to understand anything that is not detailed. Such people can usually do a lot better in 3rd house type of knowledge, where data are less complex and more thoroughly defined. Ninth house Chiron people need to follow patterns; this makes it more easy for them to absorb information and make the necessary connections for its processing. Another difficulty that might appear in their lives is to learn foreign languages. Yet, even if they are slow learners, they can excel in the end and even teach.\nA 9th house Chiron person tends to be unlucky concerning the types of people he will meet abroad. During his travels, he will meet ill-tempered foreigners, which will make him have even more prejudice towards other cultures. In fact, his thirst of understanding other civilizations will always be strong; yet some disappointing experiences will build a wall towards their realization.\nThe same pattern can appear concerning religion. The individual has a strong drive towards spirituality; on the other hand people who practice religion will also disappoint him. Chiron in the 9th house indicates that the archetype of the priest/guru can also create traumas. In some extreme cases, where Chiron is adversely aspected by both Mars, Pluto and Saturn, the chart owner might have even been molested by a person connected to religion. Of course, for such a scenario, houses ruling his body or sexuality must be involved.\nOf course, the severity of the emotional trauma connected to Chiron largely depends on the aspects of natal planets. Squares, oppositions and conjunctions with malefics indicate more difficult situations, while harmonious aspects with planets will actually teach the native how to develop his view on the matter of possessions and belongings.\nA good exercise to empower a 9th house Chiron, is to dig deep in your childhood years and see what or who was causing you fear and restrain.  In case it is a physical person of importance, even talking to him about it would help. In case it is a situation, someone unreachable or not important, the best way is to resolve the matter symbolically. The best way to energize Chiron is through symbolical demolition of the archetypes that cause pain. In the end, you will understand that these traumas are just leftovers of the past; they do not offer you anything precious but fear and stress. \n \n\n\nIn this occasion, diving without fear into 9th house matters can solve a lot. Learn that foreign language, practice foreign traditions and mix with people that have different cultural background. Your own walls of perception will slowly fall apart, and your 9th house will start again functioning normally. If you have this placement, your path of transcending your traumas passes through communicating, while also getting engaged in other activities that involve surroundings you feel as distant and weird. Alternatively, another great 9th house activity that can help you heal yourself writing and publishing material connected to these issues. Writing about your own 9th house problems, can educate others that also have similar. \n \n\n\nIn the end, this transformative healing experience can give them excellent insights. A curious pattern is that a 9th house Chiron person is better in teaching other people about how to expand their spirituality, than they can their own. This always happens when Chiron is involved; the native can perfectly teach and preach even things that he is not able to implement in his own life. Yet, those who listen him, can! Be wise enough to apply your great advice on your own self too, and you will figure out the best way to deal with what holds you back!\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:54:04'),
(1531, 0, 'us', 'chiron-in-8th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Chiron in the 8th house of a natal chart indicates some emotional wounds connected with death, sexuality or even the occult. Those wounds are hidden in the native’s childhood, and might be even partially erased from his conscious memory. The eight house is ruling all taboo subjects, and thus such experiences may have been automatically categorized by the native’s brain as so taboo as to not be reachable. \n \n\n\nChiron in the 8th can also signify an early disappointment connected to using other people’s resources, which automatically makes this subject hurtful. Someone of the native’s close persons may have made him embarrassed or hurt when he asked money or something else that was not his. As a result, an 8th house Chiron individual will always feel uncomfortable with using other people’s assets and possessions. He will not borrow money and generally try to use as less as he can objects that belong to others. \n \n\n\nGenerally, asteroid Chiron is responsible for traumas and their healing; thus the house where it is placed is a rather sensitive area of the native’s life. In case that the asteroid is negatively aspected, especially by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native may have experienced quite a lot of suffering. On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in the respective life area, as the native has learnt quite a lot from his own experiences. This natal placement is quite good for people who work with sexually abused people.\nChiron in the house of sex may make the person shy to indulge in sexual relations. He might be overly cautious and reserved. With difficult aspects, the native might have experienced sexual abuse, or at least an attempt of it. Alternatively, as a youngster he had formed the perception that sex is something rough and cruel, being afraid to practice it when the time comes. There are possibilities of sexual dysfunction – mostly due to psychological reasons. The individual will not trust a partner easily, so he might restrain from sexual acts longer than other people.\nOther people might consider him conservative about his views on sexuality; the truth is that he could even become a sexual healer. If and when he reaches a level of understanding the reasons behind his traumas, he might be able to heal and guide other people who have similar ones. This will happen even if he never manages to fully heal his own; the native will be way better as an adviser for others than for himself. It may take long time until the individual may be able to merge totally with a partner through sex; mutual respect, care and stability are the best ways to open up those tightly closed gates.\nIn addition, the 8th house Chiron person may have experienced a dramatic loss of a dear person during his childhood. Thus, death is a synonym for pain in his mind. He may be constantly worrying about the death of his beloved people, as he does not want to experience again the same type of emotional pain.\nAs the 8th house is ruling inheritances, the presence of Chiron may create turbulence concerning those issues too. The individual may have experienced stress in his young age due to his family arguing about the legacy of a deceased person. During his adult life, Chiron can also complex such subjects and bring sorrow through alienating with relatives when the time comes to share resources left from someone who passed away. The asteroid’s presence is also not good for tax-related issues, and all who have this placement are advised to be careful when taking loans from institutions. \n \n\n\nThe 8th house is also ruling the occult, and Chiron indicates fear towards it. This fear might be connected with some real metaphysical experience of the childhood; yet this is not necessary to have happened. Many kids develop fear towards the unknown, and it just needs a little bit more vivid fantasy to create stressful situations from nothing. On the other hand, this placement can be indeed an indicator of being a victim of magic, and have a constant emotional trauma connected to attacks from the outer realms.\nIn addition, an 8th house Chiron person may fear secrets and their revelation. He will be always cautious about what he speaks to other people, as he has probably been betrayed and seen his secrets get known to the public.\nGenerally, this placement creates a good yet hurt person, who can experience victimization or exploitations from people with darker souls than him. This can put him in a nutshell, as he feels a constant urge to defend from possible manipulators.\nIf you have this placement, we strongly advise you to be careful about the quality of people you have around you. Choose carefully nice people so that you can relax in their presence, and keep away from people that can be practicing the occult. Be careful of psychic or sexual vampires, and find out ways to activate your healing abilities.\nOne must examine all thenatal aspects of Chiron so that he understands the whole big picture.

Chiron’s presence here shows unresolved traumas concerning the concept of unification. It can signify early disappointments in the native’s love life relationships, and a subconscious fear to tie one’s reality to another person.\nGenerally, asteroid Chiron is responsible for traumas and their healing; thus the house where it is placed is a rather sensitive area of the native’s life. In case that the asteroid is negatively aspected, especially by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native may have experienced quite a lot of suffering. On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in the respective life area, as the native has amassed a lot of wisdom through his own experiences.\nChiron in the house of relationships can indicate problems in the native’s parents relationship. Their marriage may have been quite unstable or even ended by a divorce, and the young native naturally perceives partnerships as something stressful. This can make him rather hesitant to enter some deep union, as fears of disharmony or rejection may constantly crawl in his mind. The native may pass long periods of feeling unwanted, even if his relations run rather smooth. The discomfort will frequently come through depressive ideas about a catastrophe that yet is to come in the future. Thus, a 7th house Chiron person may delay his marriage or even prefer to never unite formally with another person.\nThe same patterns can appear in career relationships, where the individual will feel often suspicious about possible partners. The native will not sign contracts easily, and will definitely prefer to create a company alone rather than include other people as co-owners. Yet, Chiron does not indicate failures when uniting forces with others. The asteroid affects mostly the native’s own perception, and not directly the events connected with his partnerships. Also, Chiron’s placement can show us early life traumas more than future situations, and can also bear some karmic debts from previous lives. \n \n\n\nWith an adversely aspected natal Chiron, the native was probably forced towards some type of partnership during his young ages. Alternatively, he has become witness of unhealthy or painful relationships, becoming convinced that he needs to protect himself from similar behaviors. Soft aspects to the asteroid mainly imply that those experiences did not hurt him deep, but actually granted him wisdom concerning such matters. \n \n\n\nEven though a 7th house Chiron person may mess up with his own partnerships, his abilities of consulting others may be exquisite. The native can excel in advising others about their relationships, and can even become a good psychologist for couples. Chiron can unveil to him the destructive patterns that can poison a marriage, while also the antidotes to heal from them. In addition, the native’s own inability to merge with a significant other can inspire him in helping others achieve that. Furthermore, this placement can be also good for becoming a catalyst between two or more sides in a business partnership. The native can aid all sides find the necessary balances in order to function properly, or work out possible disputes and problems.\nYet, Chiron himself cannot create a professional healer, and more planetary aspects are needed to make the native follow a career as a marriage counselor. Otherwise, the individual will just be considered by his friends as the right person to approach in case they are facing such types of trouble. His advice will give insight and different points of view to anyone who consults him. Also, he will be able to propose strategies or remedies for solving any disbalance. The cumulated wisdom through various observations on partnerships will make the chart owner find the roots of problems, while also possible ways to heal them. \n \n\n\nChiron in the 7th house can also signify a very hurt partner. Your significant other might be an underdog, have low self-esteem or even some form of physical debility. This urges the native to take care of him, becoming the leading partner in the relationship. In such a situation, the healing attributes of Chiron are being awakened, and the native will exercise them on his partner. The chart owner uses this relationship in order to forget his own traumas, which most of the times are of a less sharp nature than his partner’s. Thus, both of them are healed- and in many occasions this mutual progress can be of a karmic nature.\nThe best way to make Chiron function well when in the 7th house is understanding that you are a self-luminous person. Yes, relationships are important; but even failures concerning them are not the end of the world.  Do not allow your fears make you lose a good person who tries to enter your life. Of course, there is always the risk of being hurt again, but fear is the biggest enemy and not failure.\nNevertheless, be careful of not dedicate too much time towards your partners.

(1533, 0, 'us', 'chiron-in-6th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Chiron in the 6th house of a natal chart indicates some emotional wounds connected with how the native perceives work and service towards others. The sixth house rules employment, health and our daily routines; Chiron’s presence here shows unresolved traumas related to everyday responsibilities. Chiron in the sixth house can also signify an early disappointment in the native’s career, and failures to harmonically cooperate with employers.\nGenerally, asteroid Chiron is responsible for traumas and their healing; thus the house where it is placed is a rather sensitive area of the native’s life. In case that the asteroid is negatively aspected, especially by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native may have experienced quite a lot of suffering. On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in the respective life area, as the native has learnt quite a lot from his own experiences.\nChiron in the house of our daily routines shows that the native as a child did not like to follow the daily advice of his parents. He probably did not like doing his homework, shower or brush his teeth, while also was rejecting their attempts to build him a stable schedule of sleep. Generally, he would prefer to act chaotically and choose his own rhythms. With an adversely aspected natal Chiron, the native was probably forced to follow the parents’ orders. Soft aspects to the asteroid show that the parents were not too strict on such behaviors that he developed, which in turn did not create him deep traumas concerning his routines.\nA 6th house Chiron person simply cannot stand the procedures and routines of a working place. He may feel from bored to enslaved, and definitely will prefer to do alternative jobs that do not require a stable timetable or have recurring events. There can be also problems with co-workers or the employer, and a general feeling of not belonging to the place he works.\nAs the 6th house is connected with health, the placement of Chiron indicates frequent worries about the native’s body condition. Yet, he may stall in such a situation of worry and not act somehow in order to help himself. On the other hand, this natal placement can make him excel in advising others for their health. Such an individual can become a good nutritionist, pharmacist or homeopathic healer. Difficult aspects to Chiron may enlarge phobias about one’s health, leading to hypochondria.\nThis natal placement is quite good for people who work as healers themselves. Chiron in the 6th can indicate an inclination to become a psychotherapist, or elsehow support people that are in need. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily have to be an official profession. The 6th house is also ruling our service towards others, and the planet Chiron bears strong characteristics of altruism. A 6th house Chiron person can offer his advice and help for free, especially to those that are in an urgent need. Many times, the help provided to people by such an individual has roots in the absence of help from others when he himself was in need. Having experiences such situations himself, his ethics do not allow him to leave someone else helpless. \n \n\n\nIn addition, a sixth house Chiron person may be an expert in job advice. Even if his own career life does not correspond to the advice he gives, he can offer very helpful tips about working. Usually, such people are the best for supporting their friends and acquaintances through developing strategic patterns that can be used in one’s job surroundings.\nThe best way to make Chiron function in a good way when in the 6th house, is curiously enough having small pets! The small animals are a 6th house matter, and we all know how important healers they can be themselves. Get closer to a cat or a dog, and let it be your own teacher. You will gradually understand that by synchronizing to them- and even to their biorhythms- you can build a healthy daily routine and soften any possible hard aspects your Chiron has! \n \n\n\nIf you have this placement, we strongly advise you to examine the natal aspects of Chiron so that you understand the whole big picture.

The fifth house rules recreational activities and fun; thus its presence here shows unresolved traumas related to the house’s matters. Chiron in the fifth house can also signify an early disappointment in the native’s love life, a broken heart from a childhood crush. \n \n\n\nGenerally, asteroid Chiron is responsible for traumas and their healing; thus the house where it is placed is a rather sensitive area of the native’s life. In case that the asteroid is negatively aspected, especially by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native may have experienced quite a lot of suffering. On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in the respective life area, as the native has learnt quite a lot from his own experiences.\nChiron in the house of creative self-expression may make the person shy to party. This placement can frequently give tendencies to sit in the corner and look at others having fun, instead of becoming the heart of the company. This behavior can trace back to childhood parties or playtime, when the individual was feeling quite alienated by the other children and not invited to participate in the activity even if he yearned for it.\nIn addition, the native may have experienced difficulties in love during his young years. He may have been rejected by his childhood sweetheart, or even never expressed his affection towards that person. Such a rejection can influence his adult life, making him feel insecure about expressing feelings. Indeed, a fifth house Chiron individual may frequently feel as a child when falling in love, unable to think clearly and find the courage to approach the desired person. His sexual energy may have awakened rather early, definitely earlier than the other kids around him. The lack of stereotypes to follow makes the child confused, as it is difficult to dive into subjects such as love and sexuality when even your desired partner is not mature enough to be aware of them. \n \n\n\nThe 5th house is also ruling children, and Chiron’s placement can create some complications concerning this matter. The planet definitely creates a desire to have a child, yet can make the native very anxious about his ability to handle and grow it. The asteroid can give great relations with children in general; on the other hand there are native bears huge doubts about whether he will be a good parent himself. Another fear it can create is the phobia of not being able to have children, or a general worry about how to treat them. As a result, such a native is prone to be a rather strict parent and generally give love in a wrong way. His worries about the child’s future can make their relationship rather complicated.\nIn case you have this placement, it will be a pity to allow your oversensitivity poison your relations with your offspring. Actually, you may not even notice some difficult traits you will have as a parent, and the reason behind that is that you are perfect in consulting other people about how to grow their children. Yet, you do not follow your own advice, allowing deeper instincts of fears to take control. Observe yourself consciously and try to end any vicious cycles of traumas that Chiron has passed to you.\nThis natal placement is quite good for people who work with children, no matter if they are teachers, sports trainers or child psychologists. Chiron may gift them with great abilities of healing young individuals, and empower their dreams. Having experienced disappointments himself, he knows how to aid youngsters in order to not get disappointed by the same issues. \n \n\n\nIn addition, a fifth house Chiron person may be an expert in romance advice. Even if his own life does not correspond to the advice he gives, he can offer very helpful tips about love. Usually, such people do not become psychologists for couples but just support their friends and acquaintances with coaching about love affairs.\nIf you have this placement, we strongly advise you to examine the natal aspects of Chiron so that you understand the whole big picture. Sometimes, by strengthening the planets that trine or sextile Chiron you can indirectly heal yourself, without having to dedicate a lot of time and effort in researching your childhood years with the aid of a professional.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:54:20'),

The fourth house rules our roots and domestic environment, and thus its presence there shows unresolved traumas related to the houses’ matters. Chiron in the fourth house is one of the most difficult placements to have, especially if it is adversely aspected by malefics. \n \n\n\nGenerally, asteroid Chiron is responsible for traumas and their healing; thus the house where it is placed is a rather sensitive area of the native’s life. In case that the asteroid is negatively aspected, especially by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native may have experienced quite a lot of suffering. On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in such matters, as the native has learnt quite a lot from his own experiences.\nWith the asteroid placed in the 4th house, the native probably had a difficult childhood, even during periods that his conscious mind does not recall any memories. The atmosphere hovering above the infant was highly threatening and he was forced to build defenses from an early age.\nAs the 4th house rules one’s home, there was probably a lot of disharmony concerning the places of living. Traumas can be connected to frequent moving to new houses and a general feeling of instability in his home life. In addition, the less dominant parent (usually the mother) might be perceived as a threat due to negative energy expelled. The individual can have experienced being thrown out of the house as a family due to debts, or elsehow feel a lack of a “nest” where he can feel comfortable. This feeling can be transferred to the native’s adult life, making him extremely cautious about his home surroundings and actually never feeling well at his own place.\nAnother frequent pattern to appear is being sent away to grandparents or other relatives for some periods, especially during times when the whole family is suffering. Of course, the young native translates such experiences as a lack of attention towards him and a general sense of fear is hovering in his mind. Indeed, the whole problematic situation might even create expectations of more suffering, and the native’s first opinion about life is that it is a rather painful and difficult procedure.\nIn the end, this transformative healing experience can make you aid others who have similar problems. It will make you rather compassionate towards people experiencing trouble with their expression, and even make you sensitive towards everyone who is unable to speak their mind, no matter for what reason. \n \n\n\nGenerally, one of the difficulties of this placement is that Chiron’s effects are hidden in the deepest layers of the person’s psyche. As we already mentioned, a lot of his traumas are being created during periods that he still has not developed his conscious thought and thus they are hard to deal with. In extreme situations, professional psychoanalysis can be the only thing that can help in order to dig deep into the subconscious and understand the nature of the problems.\nOf course, this is not necessary if the individual can consciously forget and forgive those past situations. Indeed, if the effects of Chiron are not severe, this tactic can prove the best for self-healing. \n \n\n\nNaturally, such a native can develop exquisite healing abilities concerning people that have similar problems. A fourth house Chiron person can be a great advisor for children with family problems, orphans or anyone who has had a disturbed childhood. Getting involved in such practices will be also a symbolical way to heal his own self. Indeed, observing himself aiding other similar cases a lot of personal emotional pains can soften, or even disappear. Of course, in order to become a healer a lot more natal aspects should be present. Planets in the 6th or 12th in aspect to natal Chiron may be indicators of a career or volunteering in such projects. Otherwise, the native’s healer potential will mostly manifest in random cases of people he meets through his life.\nIf you have this placement, we strongly advise you to examine the natal aspects of Chiron so that you understand the whole big picture.

The third house rules our interactions with the immediate environment, and thus its presence there shows unresolved traumas related to the houses’ matters, and mostly has influence on the native’s early years. \n \n\n\nGenerally, asteroid Chiron is responsible for traumas and their healing; thus the house where it is placed is a rather sensitive area of the native’s life. In case that the asteroid is negatively aspected, especially by malefics such as Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the native may have experienced quite a lot of suffering. On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in such matters, as the native has learnt quite a lot from his own experiences.\nA person with his Chiron placed in the 3rd house might have difficult childhood experiences concerning the ways he expresses himself. As the 3rd house is ruling one’s basic education, the native as a child has faced misunderstandings in schools and an overall hostile atmosphere that he connects with communication. Chiron may make him afraid to speak his opinion, as it might get ridiculed by the teachers or other pupils. In the best situation, his words are being ignored; in more severe cases he might even get continuously insulted and verbally harassed. \n \n\n\nIn case that Chiron adversely aspects natal Mercury, the native might have difficulties in speech such as dyslexia or other mild handicaps. Generally, all the traumas at school might be even connected to the native’s funny voice, strange (or foreign) accent, or anything else verbal that can alienate him from the mass of pupils.\nSuch incidents may hurt the native’s self esteem, making him feel less mentally adequate than other people in his class. As a result, he will often tend to keep silent in order to not experience humiliation. If Chiron is not adversely aspected, it mostly shows alienation from the rest of the class, as the native does not feel comfortable with speaking to other people. There might not be an apparent reason, or the roots of this behavior might rely on some incident hidden in the early childhood and connected to the idea “No speaking, no problem”. In any case, the marks of Chiron will definitely reappear during transits and eventually manifest in the native’s adult life. Of course, during his conscious observation of these pattern the native can not only heal his own wounds but also become helpful to people that have common problems but of a worse nature.\nA 3rd house Chiron person might also experience quite a lot of issues with his siblings. As the 3rd house rules brothers and sisters, the native may be bullied by them and quarrel a lot. Usually, Chiron shows that the chart owner is the one that loses the fights, gets intimidated and is left with feelings of having suffered injustice. People with such a placement frequently have older siblings, who out of jealousy mistreat them. Of course, in such young years the native is quite defenseless towards an older, stronger and more powerful person. The trauma usually involves unresolved questions such as how can a family member who is supposed to express love, act in malicious ways towards the individual.\nIf no siblings exist, this fact might be exactly the cause of trauma. The native might be yearning to have a brother or a sister to communicate with, but life did not offer this blessing so the native was feeling quite lonely concerning that matter. \n \n\n\nMore rarely, the problems that Chiron in the 3rd house creates are linked to ill-tempered neighbors that cause fear to the child, or painful situations that happen during nearby short traveling. In extreme situations when the asteroid is very badly aspected, a pattern of avoiding having neighbors or going to nearby trips can be created. Of course, after reaching a conscious age to understand this problematic behavior (or a highly beneficial transit that will heal it), the native will be able to see his 3rd house matters function better.\nAs a result of Chiron’s placement, the child strongly connects self-confidence with expressing himself in a harmonious way; this pattern will follow him during his adult life and he will seek pleasant surroundings in order to feel secure. For such an individual, communicative people that do not judge or mock will be an elixir of self-healing. Eventually, through choosing correct discussants he will be able to establish a better flow of speech and information.\nIn addition, Chiron will definitely bring efforts of reconciliation with the siblings. This may be even done without conscious effort; the native will always be thirsty for softening any childhood disputes. A positive transit will definitely trigger attempts of dissolving issues between the native and his brother or sister.\nOf course, the severity of the emotional trauma largely depends on the aspects of natal planets. Squares, oppositions and conjunctions with Mars, Saturn and Pluto indicate more difficult situations, while harmonious aspects with planets will actually teach the native how to develop his view on the matter of possessions and belongings.\nChiron in the 3rd house can bring disappointment to the native during his early education. It will rather feel as a burden, and his memories of it afterwards will frequently be of a depressive flavor.\nA good exercise to empower a 3rd house Chiron, is to dig deep in your childhood years and see what or who was causing you fear and restrain. In case it is a physical person of importance, even talking to him about it would help. In case it is a situation, someone unreachable or not important, the best way is to resolve the matter symbolically. The best way to energize Chiron is through symbolical demolition of the archetypes that cause pain. In the end, you will understand that these traumas are just leftovers of the past; they do not offer you anything precious but fear and stress. \n \n\n\nIf you have this placement, your path of transcending your traumas passes through communicating, while also getting engaged in other activities that involve your immediate surroundings. Start making some short trips, friendships in your neighborhood and pass more time with your siblings and cousins. Alternatively, another great 3rd house activity that can help you heal yourself is using your hands for creative reasons. No matter if it is writing, painting, creating sculptures or anything else with your hands, your natal Chiron will be empowered.\nIn the end, this transformative healing experience can make you aid others who have similar problems. It will make you rather compassionate towards people experiencing trouble with their expression, and even make you sensitive towards everyone who is unable to speak their mind, no matter for what reason.\nA curious pattern is that a 3rd house Chiron person is better in teaching other people about how to manage their communication, than they can their own.

As a child, his family might be experiencing financial problems, having as an effect the development of insecurity to the child about the belongings of him and his family. Seeing the struggle of his parents, the child can even feel guilt and accuse himself for being a financial burden to the family.

In fact, the second house refers to everything that the native believes he owns, and his personal assets can be even ideas or people. Thus, for aiding his natal Chiron in his healing procedure, the individual must realize that his self-worth is an outcome of more parameters than he believes.\nA good exercise to empower a 2nd house Chiron, is to try relinquishing some possessions, especially when you struggle with lacking them.

On the other hand, a well-aspected Chiron indicates abilities of healing other people in such matters, as the native has learnt quite a lot from his own experiences.\nWhen Chiron is present in the first house of an individual, the traumas he bears are concerning his physical body, his character and his self-perception. In numerous cases such natives have experienced bullying in school, which with the hard aspects involve also physical abuse. \n \n\n\nAlternatively, a first-house Chiron person may have serious issues with accepting his appearance. Other people may make fun of some personal characteristic, and he develops a low self-confidence, believing he is ugly. Chiron placed here can also make the native feel alienated by the people around him, and generally feel quite uncomfortable in his own skin. This aspect may have as effect difficulties in self-definition; people with Chiron in the first house need more time to understand their own self. Usually, this comes through some liberating transit of a slow-moving planet through the first house, which permanently transforms the opinion the native has for himself. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, all this suffering develops great abilities of aiding people with similar problems. Even if the native himself has not surpassed his own traumas, he is able to help the less fortunate with his wisdom obtained through difficulties. This desire to help others is connected with a subconscious need to feel part of a similar group of people. By aiding others surpass their pain concerning similar traumas, the native heals his own self. A curious fact is that his advice will frequently help others surpass their issues more quickly that he will his own.\nChiron in the 1st house is a rather difficult placement, and requires intensive and conscious self-healing in order to function better. The traumatic patterns are hidden deep inside the native’s mind, and in order to reprogram such deep layers a lot of effort is needed.\nIf you have this natal position, you should start by accepting yourself and your appearance, and understand that many personal traits all people have are unchangeable. Forgive any people who mistreated you during your childhood; children rarely act consciously, and there is no way you can change the past. It is your future that is important, and letting go of previous negative experiences is the only way. Understand that your own self can be only constructed by available elements, and your body and character are necessary bricks that you should strengthen to build it stable. \n \n\n\nContinue using your experiences in order to support others, especially those who are younger and have not managed yet to pass the road that you already did.

(1539, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-5th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nBeing located in the 5th house is a rather difficult position for Saturn. Even when it is well-aspected, its presence in the house of joy will restrain the native from the small amusements of life, giving a rather serious approach to his life.\nThe gloomy and cold nature of Saturn is definitely not the best to have in the house of pleasure. While most people party, a native with such an aspect might by shy to join fun activities or even consider them as something not interesting. He may have a very serious character concerning fun activities, and during his childhood the elder members of the family were frowning upon joy. They might be considering playing, laughing and passing a good time as a sin; thus the native can grow up in surroundings that do not allow happiness to flourish. \n \n\n\nThe native will have hard time being spontaneous, as his reactions have structured patterns. The best advice is to relax and try to enjoy yourself, even if it is difficult to adopt to such situations. Such a native might even consider the noise of a party something repulsive, preferring more solitary ways of entertainment. In addition, a person with Saturn in the 5th house is not dating a lot, and his relationships are mostly based on issues of stability. His views on dating are rather conservative, and when they find someone with the same kind of views they tie with him and try to build something more solid than just fool around. The best love partners for such kind of people are individuals who also have Saturn in their 5th house.\nAs the fifth house is responsible for one’s children, Saturn’s presence tends to obstruct having one. The native can have low fertility or be totally unable to have children, but this is not necessary to be the rule. The native himself might not want children, and Saturn can create a conscious choice of not procreating. Saturn can bring a child in the native’s old years, and usually the relationship with such a child is problematic due to the generational difference. People with such a placement might want to reconsider their stance towards having children, as an adversely aspected Saturn might bring misfortunes with their offspring.\nThis natal placement of Saturn urges the native to be in environments where there is no need for creativity. They like having a routine, programming and planning their future, while also the way they feel joy. There might be solitary hobbies like collecting and constructing things. Also, such people will hardly ever gamble in their lives. They neither find any kind of joy in it, nor like to win or lose money. Their ethics might even consider gambling a despicable sin. On the other hand, this placement can give a lot of wisdom, as the native invests a lot of time in himself instead of having fun. Becoming serious from his early ages, he can become a good professional if his natal Saturn is also connected to the 10th or the 6th house. In both cases, this comes together with becoming a workaholic.\nThe native might have received little love during his childhood, and feel unappreciated. This pattern taught him to also show little love and affection towards other. His relationships will definitely not have going out and making out in public- these things are kept for the indoors. As the person does not celebrate a lot with others, this fact in turn does not increase his popularity. The native is definitely not the first to be invited by others in a Friday night out. Nevertheless, with the people that he is near he will indulge in other activities of recreation. These would be of a different style, more adult-ish and serious. Common hobbies with others should have a practical purpose, so that he enjoys them. Also, such a native does not enjoy in giving or receiving presents, considering this movement as fake and lame. Even if he does, he will stubbornly pretend that all this is foolish and that people should focus on more important things. \n \n\n\nThe best ways to soften such a Saturn is to not be overly critical as the native’s parents were, and try to adapt themselves to situations where they can relax and feel joy. The world must be perceived in a more easy way; worrying is not the only important thing in life. Natives with a 5th house Saturn must raise their self confidence through group activities, and harmonize the differences that separate them from the masses. Also, a great benefit that this Saturn position has, is the chance of creating something artistic that will survive in time. Such people can become great architects or builders, and if Saturn is positively aspected their creations might stand long after the native departs from this world. If you have such an aspect, don’t be afraid to love! It is actually what you mostly yearn for, and maybe it terrifies you.

The person who has born under such a placement usually starts talking and communicating later than other kids, might have a rather slow and careful speech or be very shy to express his thoughts. His mind takes more time to process the information, and even if his intelligence is not lower than other peoples’ the world frequently thinks he is of lower intelligence. There are possibilities of dyslexia or other speech defects, especially when Saturn is afflicting natal Mercury. Even if the native is of high intelligence, his immediate surroundings are making him feel inferior, which he passively accepts as a fact until he finds out the opposite himself.  The person can be just a late bloomer, having a slower tempo of development. On the other hand, Saturn creates a very stable basis from the knowledge acquired. What is being learnt is integrated in a quite steady and organized system of thought, which in the long term can create a more functional brain than someone’s who absorbs information quickly but structures it chaotically. \n \n\n\nThis natal placement can even temporarily interrupt the native’s education; nevertheless the presence of Saturn in a house makes the individual dedicate a lot of effort to the areas of life represented in it. The 3rd house Saturn person will maybe struggle with his studies will maybe need to invest double the time that others do, but has a rather serious approach towards his goals. For him, success in studies might become a very important goal; it also represents fighting his own fears. The positive thing is that Saturn gives endurance and patience; these are the two best weapons for accomplishing such kind of tasks. \n \n\n\nA third house Saturn person is a minimalist concerning his communications. His sentences are rather laconic, he will not phone or text someone first and will generally be quite cautious and reserved concerning what he speaks. This sometimes can be a great aspect for some types of professions, especially those that need the worker to keep a discreet stance. These people are great for handling secret information and papers, and for jobs where there must be minimum interaction between the employer and the employee. “Words are silver, silence is gold” says a proverb, and this is exactly what can be said about such situations.\nWhen Saturn resides in the third house of a native, there can be a lot of issues with his siblings. Saturn can make the relations rather cold, as its gloomy nature does not allow the flow of feelings. When other malefics such as Mars or Pluto are involved with hard aspects, the native will have an abusive sibling who diminishes the native’s self confidence since their young ages. The parents are frequently favoring the other child, which furthermore represses the native’s self-esteem and gives feelings of abandonment. \n \n\n\nIf you have Saturn in the third house, you should take extra care of your lungs. Individuals who have such a natal aspect are advised not to smoke, to live in houses without a lot of humidity and to check their lungs frequently. As the third house is responsible about short journeys and transportation, Saturn is creating blockades and fears in anything connected with that. The individual might be afraid to learn driving, or even after receiving his driving license will feel uncomfortable in taking the initiative to do that. In addition, it might create minor problems in short trips, which will in turn create a subconscious negation towards making more journeys.\nTo conclude, if you have Saturn in the third house you should always be careful of the melancholic tendencies that tend to creep in your head. These tendencies of depression are rather fixed from the young years, and the best way to battle them is by illuminating the gloomy atmosphere that Saturn creates in your 3rd house. This, of course, will come through opening up towards other people, through socializing and communicating. Start crafting things with your hands (a great 3rd house empowerment technique) and try to be less shy. Observe when a positive transit from Jupiter or Uranus will apply to your natal Saturn, and do not lose the opportunity to open yourself up! This can be done with any planet forming a trine or a sextile to Saturn, but these two are the best for this cause. Jupiter, the grand benefic positively expands all the issues of the house and can help you with injections of joy, while Uranus will bring unpredictable innovations in your approach to the 3rd house issues. In any case, throw a smile on your face; even if it is a fake one in the beginning. After a while, your mind will find a reason for it being real.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:56:45'),
(1541, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-2nd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nUsually, wherever Saturn is located in a natal chart signifies a problematic life area, as the ringed planet is considered a malefic. Does this general rule apply, though, when Saturn is placed in the house of material possessions and wealth? The truth is somewhere in the middle. \n \n\n\nWhen Saturn is located in the second house, its behavior is strongly connected to the aspects he forms with other planets, while also to the sign in which it resides. Even though it is considered a rather restrictive planet, if it is placed in Libra, Scorpio, Capricorn or Aquarius he tends to reveal his positive traits. The same applies when he forms good natal aspects to planets; a supportive Jupiter or Venus might even turn him into a benefic. Nevertheless, the whole picture is more than complicate to understand.\nSaturn in the second house gives a person who has been born to a poor family, or who has quickly and easily learnt to be able to live on minimal resources. This creates a survivor, someone who will start his finances from zero. Saturn is a slow moving and limitative planet, adoring hard work, serious approach and slow steps. When it is located in the house of finances, the individual will dedicate a lot of time and effort to build his income and establish his security net. The native needs to heal the traumas of his financial difficulties, so the second house issues are a very important area of his life where he shows extreme seriousness. This aspect can create workaholics, while in some situations when Saturn is very well-aspected even millionaires. In any case, success comes slowly and usually late in life. Nevertheless, when it comes there is no turning back; Saturn is the most stable planet and also protector of the old age. This placement signifies very wealthy old years.\nWhen Saturn is located in the 2nd, the natal chart owner will not gamble or otherwise risk losses of wealth. The planet’s gloomy character may make the native forget about enjoying the money he earns, and keep too much aside for a rainy day. In extreme situations, it can create a very stingy person, which many times is not at all visible to himself. In addition, Saturn can bring melancholic thoughts and depression over material matters, even if things are not going so bad.\nOf course, if Saturn is adversely aspected by malefics, the situation will be quite more difficult. The difficulties will be mostly internal, because the native will not be able to evaluate wealth correctly. He might be working too hard or too long, and just achieve some medium level income, feeling depressive of not reaching his goals of establishing an empire. His pessimism will evolve to a quite bigger problem than lack of money. \n \n\n\nPeople with such a placement are advised to treat themselves well, and celebrate the little things in life. If you have Saturn located in the 2nd house, you must understand that even though you need to cooperate with him and work hard, it is wrong to over-emphasize one planet and allow it take control of your life. By empowering some radically opposite planet in your chart, like Venus or Jupiter, you will give a lot more joy to your everyday moments and in the end receive even more pleasure while building your financial security. Search which pleasure houses are prominent in your natal chart, and don’t be afraid to indulge in activities that they rule. As a Greek proverb says, “too much work devours the boss”, so put a smile on your face and don’t forget to live! \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:56:50'),
(1542, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-1st-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nSaturn is widely known to be a malefic planet, so what happens when it is located in the house of one’s self? Relax, as things might not be so tragic – Saturn is also a great teacher, who many times through difficulties helps us evolve. His nature bonds us and restricts us, but accepting the limitations he applies on us and learning to live with them becomes the liberation from the trouble he brings.\nHaving Saturn in the first house makes the individual a rather serious person; Saturn is by no means the most enthusiastic planet of our Solar System. The native is cautious or even shy, prefers stability in his affairs and everyday reality and likes to focus in structuring his life. They are hard working, and many times life presses them to work from their early years; to grow and behave like adults too quickly. Their self-discipline is outstanding and they feel utterly responsible. Their sense of responsibility can go far way beyond what they really can have an effect on, many times making them feel guilty about things that should not be of their concern.\nTheir young ages are usually depressive, especially if Saturn is debilitated by sign or by adverse aspects from other planets. During their childhood, they did not receive a lot of love from their surroundings, and happiness was something that elders usually frowned. They are taught to be limited, to not express themselves openly and their self-confidence is usually low during their whole lives. Their parents transferred to them ideals of systematic work, goal achievements and usually were too harsh concerning criticism and failures. The child always felt like the ugly duckling, and most times Saturn does not grant beauty to the native’s body, which furthermore has an impact on the general confidence of the individual. Saturn in the first house tends to give a short body, and any difficult aspects from other planets can create various problems in the native’s appearance and body functions. Nevertheless, such natives can endure long in life and even reach deep old ages, death tends to forget them and they just (literally) shrink in size. \n \n\n\nTheir parents and family are usually very conservative, and many times religiously fanatics. They tend to keep old traditions of modesty, creating a strict behavioral shell for the native to move in. It is usually after the return of Saturn to its natal position (approximately at the 29th year of the native’s life), when he begins to open up to more liberal life philosophies and changing his attitude. The return of Saturn marks a turbulent period, which in the end liberates the individual and he starts a new life cycle, where achieving joy is a non-restricted goal. Childhood fears are starting to dissolve and the native creates a new perception of himself- the ugly duckling transforms into a totally different being. Also, children with such a placement can have suffered bullying in school, which is making them even more reserved when expressing their identity to the outer world.\nSaturn is a planet strongly connected to Karma, and the difficulties it brings are usually debts from other lives that have to be paid before the soul is allowed to set sails towards new directions. The individual tends to accumulate a lot of wisdom from early years; the difficulties that Saturn brings make him a very experienced person, which can usually become a mentor to others when of old age. If Saturn is aspecting planets in the 9th house, or has some special connection to Jupiter and/or Sagittarius, the accumulated knowledge of the native will be transferred to younger individuals and his Karmic road will be a blueprint for younger souls to learn. The native can have suffered a painful birth experience, having difficulties to come out from his mother’s womb. For the newborn, the first impressions of the outside world can be fearful and traumatic, the new surroundings might appear hostile and the first instinct to awake is self-defense.\nAs characters, people with Saturn in the first house tend to be workaholics; this is for them a way to battle pessimism and melancholy as they need to see their efforts materialize so that they understand there is a progress taking place in their lives. Another strange pattern that this planet grants, is a different perception of time. Such kind of individuals are feeling time pass a lot more slowly, and during periods that transiting planets aspect their natal Saturn they will even feel that time stands still. This explains furthermore the burdens that they experience; when difficult situations arise in their lives they might seem lasting forever.\nAs the 1st house is opposite the 7th, which is responsible for relationships and marriage, Saturn may bring delays or a quite older partner. These are sure to happen when some planet is located in the 7th house and forms an opposition to the 1st house Saturn. Nevertheless, when the individual enters a committed partnership, there is a lot of stability and it will either last long or even till the last days of the couple’s lives. \n \n\n\nIf natal Saturn is in Capricorn, Aquarius or Libra, he is bring out his good traits in the life of the individual and most of the difficulties are blunted – of course if there are no heavy aspects falling upon him from other malefics. These signs are allowing the planet to express itself like a kind teacher, and when the individual co-operates with him he can achieve all his goals through hard work and self-discipline. In such situations, the native actually adores pressure and structure because it grants him feelings of both safety and personal evolution. \n \n\n\nEven though having Saturn in the house of self is a challenging placement, the native should not get disappointed but rather try understanding what Saturn is demanding from him. When debts to Saturn are returned, he can be very generous – and his gifts usually last long. In case that your first-house Saturn is only positively aspected, then you can expect a lot of help from him as there are karmic debts towards you to be returned in this incarnation. A small piece of advice in general, for anyone facing Saturnian issues is to serve and give love to old people. When respecting the elders and offering to them, Saturn softens and offers back to you the love and care you shine on the people ruled by him. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:56:54');

(1543, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-6th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nThe 6th house is closely connected with everything that includes one’s labor, personal effort, and work; mostly not as a professional direction and career, but rather of offering your services to someone else. The people that have Saturn placed in the house, can be workaholics, as his presence makes the 6th house issues play an important role in the native’s life.\nSaturn gives quite demanding work surroundings to the native, without this meaning that they do not like it. Nevertheless, it is time-consuming and a lot of effort is being invested. When Saturn is well-aspected by other bodies, working a lot is a conscious decision, often involving family businesses that pass from father to child, becoming a tradition. Of course, such works are also usually demanding, as they are usually connected with creating handmade items or otherwise offering a lot of personal time in productivity. Saturn in the 6th gives generally a very serious approach to whatever concerns professional affairs, not allowing experimentations.\nWhen there are difficult aspects, the native will not only dedicate a lot of time towards career, but also face difficulties in reaching his goals. Saturn does not allow quick growth in the job, often offering delays, disappointments and the feeling of being paid less than what one’s work really deserves.\nThe sixth house is also responsible for one’s health. Saturn there is not the best indicator, and can bring chronic problems. These can appear to be even psychosomatic, and work can have a strong effect on their appearance. A common patter which can appear in such a native’s life, is that job difficulties and health problems strike at exact periods together. This can be observed when transiting malefic planets make squares, oppositions or conjunctions with his natal Saturn. Of course, in case that Saturn or the transiting planets are in good natal placements and have no difficult aspects, the difficulties are diminished. Nevertheless, such transits still will be periods of general turbulence, dissatisfaction and pressure. A well-aspected Saturn frequently gives a long-enduring body, that even if problematically functioning has a lot more power than other natives in overcoming its struggles. In addition, it gives the ability of being physically able for work until the native’s late years. It is frequent for them to choose not to retire, even when they have the chance to.\nWhoever has Saturn in the 6th, is often involved in serving other people. The house is ruling service and servants, and usually involves a lot of routine in his workplace. Another possibility is of working for some elder person, who has a rather cold and difficult character. Nurses are common to have Saturn among other planets occupying the 6th house. As we already mentioned, the 6th house is also responsible for health, and this makes the house prominent in people that are working in the health department. Saturn might complicate issues that concern one’s career, but he can also give a lot of stability in it. When a slow-moving trine appears towards it, it might trigger a life-lasting employment. Saturn’s stability is a double-headed knife though. A difficult square transit could also bring a long period of unemployment; in such a situation the native should observe when the tight square angle starts to loosen. \n \n\n\n6th house Saturnians have usually strong work ethics, which sometimes actually is the factor not allowing them to progress higher in the employment system. They are dedicated to what they do, conservative and responsible. Their self-denial and tendency to offer, can even reach volunteering jobs. This is more frequent when Chiron asteroid is present in the house, leading the native to accept altruistic roles in the society; such a person would have as a life goal to offer his healing services towards others. \n \n\n\nTe 6th house is also known to govern all small animals. A person with Saturn present there, could have a rather cold attitude towards dogs, cats and other little fluffy friends. The curious thing, is that if such a native has problems with his job or health, animals are his solution. By paying more attention to them, giving time and blending with their personalities, he is softening the Saturnian harshness, which can project back in his reality as a gradual stabilization of his other problems. So, the best advice for such a native is to spend time with them. Learn from their attitude, allow them to show you their unconditional love and give it back. It is even logical; small happy moments daily with an animal can cure stress and give a more optimistic approach to the everyday reality. This can create in its turn a wider pattern of self-healing, of forgetting difficult work situations and reaching again more harmonic routines.\nWhen someone is born with Saturn in the 6th, he should many times be careful not getting married before his 30 years. The reason behind this is quite simple: Saturn travels a full circle of the zodiac for about 29 years.  When someone reaches his 30’s Saturn is entering his 7th house, after having made its natal return to his birth point. The 7th house is responsible for marriage, and in case someone is already married by the time that he crosses the Descendant, there is high possibility of passing two difficult years during his transit. The ideal would be to wait for him to reach near the 8th house cusp and then consider uniting with another person. Also, someone who has not still experienced his Saturn Return (when he passes from the same degree as the natal), should be careful of health issues during that period. It can signify a very stressful year or two. Arthritic-related issues could appear, and the bones are usually a sensitive part of their body. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:56:58'),
(1544, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-12th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving Saturn in the 12th house is probably one of the most difficult placements a native can have. Especially if the planet is adversely aspected, its effect in the house of fears and restriction can lead to isolation and depression.\nAs the 12th house rules fears, the presence of any malefic planet can induce quite a lot of them. Saturn has a rather cold and restrictive energy, which can lead the native to self-limitation. He is frequently afraid to dream, which in turn leads to despair and melancholy. Many times, it is Saturn’s pessimism that actually keeps the individual away from achieving his inner wishes.\nThe 12th house is responsible for the last 2 hours before birth, and Saturn’s presence may indicate a lot of pressure in the mother’s womb. Birth itself may be difficult, a quite traumatic first experience for the newborn. This pattern may trigger quite a lot of fears towards life, as the native will be subconsciously isolating himself from the world in order to recreate the more secure surroundings of being in his mother’s body.\nSaturn himself in the 12th house and near the Ascendant is not the best indicator for health. His adverse effects are even stronger when hard aspects with Mars, Pluto or Uranus are involved. In many occasions, Saturn can indicate hospitalization due to health issues, especially in the latter stages of one’s life. \n \n\n\nIn case that Saturn is well-aspected, a lot of the placement’s difficulties will be blunted. Such a natal aspect will mostly indicate a person who enjoys being alone, and who will actually function a lot better when in isolation. It may create conscious hermits or monks, while also urge someone to abandon civilization and masses, living somewhere far from the city and passing a lot of time alone.\nThe planet is responsible of all types of restriction and places of confinement, but this does not necessarily mean that the individual will be unfortunate enough to be restricted. In fact, he may even choose a profession connected with places of seclusion. Saturn may indicate a career of caring of elder people, either at home or in hospitals. This may indeed feel like being imprisoned, as such elder people usually need a lot of attention and constant presence. In other situations, the native will have to take care of an elder family member, an experience that will devour a lot of personal time and energy.\nMost of this placement’s difficulties can be results of unconscious worries and guilt. The native with a twelfth house Saturn has tendencies to feel responsible about things he should not, and even blame himself if something does not go as it should. Anxiety and melancholy may appear without apparent reasons, and Saturn places borders in self-expression. The native may actually not be talking about his deeper thoughts to anyone, and suffer in solitude. In addition, he will be frequently hiding such behaviors, in a desperate attempt to appear well in the other people’s eyes. This placement can even create a person that subconsciously enjoys in his suffering, and does not open up towards others in order not to lose it.\nThis natal placement can bring disappointments through hidden enemies, who can be frequently of an old age. The native with Saturn in the 12th house may have bad experiences with one or more of his grandparents, and generally being mistreated by elderly people. Saturn brings delays of all types, making the native experience burdens concerning how the time passes. There will be quite a lot of occasions when subjective time in the native’s mind will pass so slowly that will be perceived as a torture. \n \n\n\nAs this placement is of the most troubled ones, the best advice we can give is to stop taking life so seriously. Fear can be the only wall standing between a human and his happiness, so if you have this placement try to be honest to yourself about your life route. Do you really want to be happy or you enjoy your seclusion? Do you really want to get rid of your fears, or are they a comfortable excuse to continue your anti-social patterns? Being a solitary person is not something negative by itself; yet experiencing the burden of self-martyrdom is not the wisest choice. Wear a smile on yourself, and understand that it is in your hands to change your everyday reality, moment by moment. Learn to accept the daily small pleasures that life grants you, as it does to everyone – no matter how difficult or easy life he has. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:57:19'),
(1545, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-11th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nAn individual with his natal Saturn in the 11th house will be very careful and serious about his friendships. The barrier he imposes may sometimes alienate him from groups and companies; nevertheless it can also act as a great filter for making the best choices concerning his friendships. \n \n\n\nAs many other astrological houses that are above the horizon, the 11th is a rather good placement for one’s natal Saturn. The house is ruled by Aquarius and planet Uranus, yet we should not forget that before Uranus’ discovery the ringed planet Saturn was considered as the sign’s ruler. Indeed, Saturn feels quite comfortable in Aquarius, and even functions in a rather open and liberated way, inheriting many of the sign’s traits. \n \n\n\nIn case that Saturn is well-aspected, the planet will actually manifest as a benefic planet, building long-lasting relationships with friends and groups that are becoming even better when they mature. Saturn’s good side indicates stability and support, and the native’s eleventh house will eventually become a basis on which he can always find shelter and safe-haven through difficulties.\nSaturn can bring quite a lot of friends who are of an older nature than the chart owner. This usually indicates a wonderful relationship with one (or more) grandparents, which the individual was considering as real friends during his childhood. This pattern continues during his whole life, as he has learnt to communicate on a higher level with older people. They perceive the native as one of theirs, even if he is still lacking in experience. Indeed, he can frequently follow a lot of the elders’ traits, and many times find through them shortcuts to wisdom that another person would need years to reach.\nOn the other hand, an adversely aspected Saturn can bring quite a lot of loneliness. The native may not trust his friends and generally abstain from group gatherings, while also have an automatic disdain towards being a member of organizations. He will like his loneliness and find comfort in it; large groups of people suffocate him and he builds an inner barrier towards such kind of events. Difficult aspects with Mars or Pluto may indicate traumas concerning friends in his childhood, which probably made the individual feel as a social outcast. Alternatively, he may have been pressured a lot by friends and feeling that a friendship has a lot of responsibilities; this may lead to preferring to pass a lot of time on his own.\nA person with Saturn in the 11th house does not open his gates easily to strangers. He prefers to hang out with people he already trusts during long time, and who have proven to be real friends. This characteristic may even lead to rejecting new acquaintances, which can be rather unfair if exercised towards everyone without even giving a chance. \n \n\n\nWhen being a part of a group, such an individual will always preserve his individual traits and will never blend totally. Even in social circles that function with balance he prefers to be a lonely wolf placed at the borders of the group, than lose his identity in the collective soul.\nThe 11th house rules goals and dreams, while also is the hidden house responsible for large wealth. Saturn placed in it does not necessarily mean failures in these matters; but definitely will delay them until the second part of one’s life. Of course, the aspects to natal Saturn have a very strong influence and adverse ones may make such achievements a quite difficult battle. Nevertheless, a well-aspected can bring a lot of fortune during the native’s old age, which can be also connected to good karma worked out through giving care and attention to old people. One could say that the grandfather’s blessings to the grandson will come into action in the right moment, and even grant a very pleasant last part of life to the individual.\nA person with natal Saturn in the 11th house is probably the best choice for the planning and organizing of a group of people. Saturn grants a strategic mind, being able to understand thoroughly the way that a group is structured and choosing correct patterns for building it. The native views groups as an architect would view a building to be constructed. A small disadvantage would be that such a native will be rather slower in developing the structure of the system, nevertheless this would enhance its stability and it would last longer. Curiously enough, the native himself would not like to be a part of it, even if he was the major contributor in its creation!\nIf you have such a natal placement, enhance it as much as you can through caring of the elder people around you. By giving love to people that most others forget you can brighten up their lives and make their final stage a lot more pleasant. In return, Saturn will not forget about you- his gifts may take long time to come but are also long lasting.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:57:26'),
(1546, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-10th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Saturn in the 10th house is domicile, as the house’s natural ruler is Capricorn. Having Saturn high in the heavens is quite a better placement than below the horizon, and especially if it is well-aspected or placed in the signs of Capricorn, Libra or Aquarius, he can even act as a benefic while in the tenth house. \n \n\n\nNevertheless, one should not expect to effortlessly activate the positive traits of the ringed planet. Saturn is all about seriousness, and when in the 10th he requires a very devoted approach to all career matters. His rewards, even if needing quite a lot of time and effort to appear, are long-lasting and can accompany the native until his last life moments. It has to be noted, that Saturn in the tenth house usually brings success in the second part of one’s life; meanwhile, his Saturn return in his late 20’s will be a very stressful and responsible period. The native may have no other life than his occupation, during the transit.\nAs the tenth house is ruling the native’s most dominant parent (usually the father), Saturn indicates that he is of a rather strict nature. He may be constantly absent due to work reasons, have a big age difference by the native and be very traditional. Saturn is also bringing a lot of pressure from this parent, who may also have very big expectations of what the native will do as a profession. This can create a lot of stress on the individual from his young years, as he is constantly feeling that must provide evidence of success to his father in order to be accepted. If Saturn is adversely aspected by Mars or Pluto, the father can be abusive; at least verbally and psychologically.\nSaturn placed here creates patterns of workaholism. The native learns from his youth to invest a lot of time in his job, and when challenges and difficulties appear he chooses to dedicate even more time and power into making his goals a reality. This placement is great for professions that need organizing; Saturn is gifting an exceptional perception of how a system must work in order to be productive, and the native will have an iron fist upon all matters concerning his career. If he is working in his own business and has employees, he is ruling them quite despotically; this contributes largely in the work’s success but can make the native unpopular or disliked. People will consider him wise but also fear him; in case that Saturn is badly aspected he may even have some cruel traits and behaviors towards co-workers; yet fear is known to also bring respect.\nThe 10th house is ruling fame, and Saturn is definitely not giving the archetype of person that shines in the eyes of the masses. An ill-aspected Pluto can bring negative fame, but negative advertisement is also a strong means of promotion. Nevertheless, the native has usually a fame of being overly serious, a sheer professionalist that knows how to do hard business. Responsibility is his second name, and other people know that working with him is not a game to be taken light-heartedly. \n \n\n\nAs the tenth house rules the jobs in which the native identifies himself, a person with such a placement will usually not work for other employers. If he does not own his own business, he might be working for some organization or institution, while also have a governmental position. Saturn here may even indicate a career in politics; usually not as a front-man but in the core group that builds the strategy of a politician or a campaign. This placement may also signify dealing with the difficult matters of a corporation, such as firing people, controlling them or elsehow impose pressure through a managerial position.\nThe best thing to do when we deal with Saturn, is of course cooperate. When you grant him what he wants, his placements and transits are of a pushy yet gentle pattern. He will respect effort and will aid in reaping the grains of success. Yet, if you do not follow the discipline that the ringed planet imposes, a slap in the face is more than possible. The final outcome will be the same; you will act as he pushes you to do – so why not doing it from the beginning? \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:57:30'),
(1547, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-9th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nEven though Saturn is a rather malefic planet, it is quite a better placement if he resides high in the heavens during the native’s birth. Natal Saturn in the 9th house will definitely require a lot of effort from the native in order to function well, but can be highly rewarding.\nThe individual with such a placement might be born to a very traditional family and usually has grandparents who have a very narrow perception of religion and education. They might be very pushy about these matters during his young years, forcing him to accept their own views. This can develop an inner rejection of religion and education in the individual and heavy disappointment about how he is being taught that life functions. On the other hand, Saturn here will create the need to break these patterns they impose, and the native will strive to find alternate explanations and ways to reach higher meanings and philosophy. \n \n\n\nSaturn might block higher education, and even if the person starts attending a university he will most probably drop out, or at least freeze his studies for some time. Natal Saturn located in the ninth house will bring highly conservative professors whose attitude repels the native and makes him indifferent towards their way of teaching. The same can be said about various religious preachers; the individual sees in their eyes old patterns of thought and will definitely not be interested in following them. On the other hand, the barrier imposed by Saturn in these matters might become an obstacle that the native will want to overcome, especially after his Saturn Return. He will then emerge more conscious about the fact that the sole reason he dislikes education and religion are the people who attempted to pass to him their views.\nIn case that Saturn is well-aspected, the native may consciously decide to continue his education in his more mature years. Such people are late bloomers concerning learning, and a bunch of them might even choose to take a university degree during their elder years. Saturn will require hard work and a lot of effort in order to accomplish this goal, but the native will not care about the difficulties, if he feels that what he does is necessary for his inner progress.\nWhen Saturn is ill-aspected, the native will probably remain dogmatic during his whole life. The reasons are deep traumas connected with his early years; he will never trust the opinion or belief of another person and in extreme cases this could lead to aggressive atheism, nihilism and a negative approach towards reality.\nUnless Saturn has very positive aspects from other planets, long distance travel and relocation will be rather a hassle than a pleasure. This natal placement of the ring planet will bring various delays and disappointments, while also create lots of trouble during the journeys. Watch out for squares, conjunctions and oppositions with Mars and Pluto; in case you have such aspects you should reconsider any ideas of living in a different country, or even visiting one for long. You will probably not be accepted well by the residents, have important cultural clashes and various minor or major difficulties may arise. If Saturn is well-aspected, there can be very rewarding journeys during the native’s old age; by that time he is a lot more ready to blend with different cultures, traditions and surroundings. \n \n\n\nIn addition, natal Saturn in the 9th house is by no means favorable for writing and publishing while still young. People that have this placement need first to experience life a lot, in order to broaden their horizons. Moreover, any quick attempts of work connected with writing will be doomed to fail, possibly also bringing a financial loss. Saturn needs his time in everything he is connected to, so if you have this placement concentrate on helping him expand. Do not forget that the 9th house is traditionally ruled by Jupiter and Sagittarius; thus Saturn placed here can have the necessary aid to expand. Of course, this can only be done through a lot of effort and rather slow progress; nothing can be done hastily when Saturn is present.\nPeople who have this natal placement are lucky enough to not have Saturn in some house that is connected to personal difficulties. Yes, he might be restricting the development of their higher ideas, but usually is not involved in problems of the body or the material surroundings. It is therefore a lot better to battle inside one’s mind than facing external threats. In case you have Saturn in the ninth, it will give you a brilliant chance of consciously self-educating, developing your own system of belief and progressing into a spirituality of your choice. Of course, you should always remember that all these need hard work and an inner battle against the borders of your own mind. There are no other walls than the ones you chose. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:57:36'),
(1548, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-8th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nA reader might expect that natal Saturn in the 8th house would bring a lot of difficulties in the matters that the house rules, yet this is definitely not the case. The 8th house can even be a very good placement for the otherwise malefic planet, provided of course that it is well-aspected. Yes, Saturn is indeed a planet that can bring difficulties depending on where it is placed, but it definitely functions in a better way when it is high in the heavens than when it is near or beneath the horizon.\nThe most important effect that this placement creates is making the native rather serious about the matters of the 8th house. The 8th house rules sex, but not the one of the casual type. Here lays the sex of unification, they mystical experience between two souls. Saturn present here will make the native very selective towards his partners, having a cautious approach about who to their intimate relation.  Saturn may temporarily block sexual activity during difficult transits, but this would rather turn out good for the native’s personal life. When not blocked, Saturn indicates steady sexual encounters inside stable relationships and can actually bring a lot of sex.\nThis placement is definitely not helpful for matters concerning loans, banks and other people’s money. The native’s calls for help will be usually rejected; people and institution will not lend him money. As a child, the individual was probably not receiving pocket money from his family, and was raised without having a sense of owning money. On the other hand, the native does not like such types of procedures and prefers to depend on his own powers. So, the reason of not receiving help may be the individual’s attitude of never requesting one.\nWhen Saturn is ill-aspected, a person must definitely not indulge in creating debts towards others, as he will suffer a lot for returning it. Also, this natal placement can give legacies that mostly consist of debts; it can indicate an inheritance that need a lot of money to get papers done and generally might create a lot of issues with receiving belongings from deceased ancestors. In addition, Saturn here may bring a very poor marriage partner, whose presence in the native’s life will be a financial burden. A lot of the native’s income may be spent for paying the spouse’s debts. \n \n\n\nA well-aspected Saturn in the eighth is a perfect natal aspect for people who work in banks. They are very thorough in their calculations and keep everything organized. The bank (or similar institutions) can trust them due to their abilities of keeping down the expenses and maximizing the income. They have a rather tight grip on finances, and in many situations will be employed in offices that mostly deny financial aid to people. Saturn can project through them in such a way that they become disliked by people when they do the dirty jobs of a bank. \n \n\n\nAs the 8th house is the realm of death, the presence of Saturn can actually block death himself! The native can live a very long life, forgotten by the scythe-bearing harvester. The native will die from old age and natural causes, while when Saturn is adversely aspected it can indicate osteoporosis or other bone problems that could lead to death. As this placement will most probably grant a long life, the individual will have to withstand a lot of deaths of other people. Indeed, this can be even more fearful than exiting our realm, and Saturn may frequently teach a person through losses. With Saturn in the 8th house the native will probably lose a person during the Saturn Return, which will be a rather difficult experience that will push him to mature and become more serious.\nThe eighth house is the house of change and transformation, and Saturn is a rather karmic teacher. An individual with this placement will definitely have to learn how to let go, no matter if it is belongings, beloved people or situations that end. Of course, he will be reborn in a new light, wiser and more experienced to embrace what is of value. \n \n\n\nIf you have this placement and it brings difficulties, the best remedy is to start accepting changes in your life. Be more open to surrender in your relationships, understand that finances are not such an important thing in life so learn to receive and give help, learn to cherish delays as a part of a complex procedure and not as an obstacle. Be a little bit less serious about the 8th house matters, and use your smile in anything connected with them. And lastly, break some sexual taboo; this might be the easiest way to start an 8th house revolution against your conservative Saturn.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:57:42'),
(1549, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-7th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nMany would expect that having natal Saturn in the 7th house is the worst position for marriage. Well, it is not! The truth is that the presence of the ringed planet can create complications in this matter, but if the native handles it well it can lead to a marital life of the utmost stability. The real question is whether the chart owner really wants this type of stability, or would prefer Saturn to block the gates of marriage. Of course, a lot is depending on aspects of other planets that apply on the native’s natal Saturn. \n \n\n\nFirst of all, we should mention that for such a natal placement of Saturn, the sign in which he resides is a key factor. If Saturn is located in Capricorn, Aquarius or Libra it will operate really well; on the contrary if he is in Cancer, Leo or Aries his traits will be rather debilitated. \n \n\n\nSaturn will most probably bring a marriage partner of an older age. The age difference is not something to be taken light-heartedly. As each of the two persons belong to a radically different generations, they have totally different needs and approaches. Both should consider very well their options, before entering into a stable bond, as love alone is not enough for the two people to function as a couple.\nA native with Saturn in the 7th house should by no means get married before his Saturn Return, which happens approximately at his 29th-30th year of age and lasts at least a year. Entering a marriage partnership before this transit is the most foolish thing to do, as the native is still too naïve to understand the burden of such a bonding. This rule should be also practiced as an act of love towards the elder partner; most marriages of people with this placement that happen before their Saturn return are instantly (or quickly) destroyed. The reason is simple; if someone gets married earlier than the transit, then in a couple of years Saturn will enter the 7th house and conjunct himself, making the partnership rather unbearable unless natal Saturn is extremely well-aspected. Even when it is, though, a lot of difficulties will appear and the native will have to become rapidly more serious in his approach towards his marital life, and life in general.\nA person with Saturn in the 7th house should be totally conscious that he is ready to see his significant other age in front of him, before he ages. He must be ready to accept the fact that he will probably have to nurture the spouse when time comes, sacrificing a lot; while also be ready to accept their death that usually comes a lot earlier than their own. In addition, such a person should understand that Saturn in the 7th indicates that their spouse searches for stability and will not want the marriage to end. If the native starts realizing in the future that he made a mistake and wants to exit the bond, the partner will definitely impose all types of pressure that this does not happen. \n \n\n\nIn case that Saturn does not bring an older partner, other Saturnian treats can develop. The spouse can be of a strong Capricorn emphasis in his chart or have Saturn in his first house; making him a rather difficult character, very serious and cold. In case you have such a natal placement, you should even consider not marrying by choice. Harsh aspects to Saturn by Pluto, Mars or Uranus are a definite no-no. These could indicate a marriage partner of an abusive nature, which in the worst situations can reach cruelty.\nOn the other hand, if Saturn is well-aspected, the native will get married only once and will have a very stable and good relationship with his partner. There might be less affection and passion, but they will be able to work out all their issues and progress together. Both will grant to each other the necessary stability; to such a point that their marriage will mostly look like a win-win business relationship.\nSpeaking of business relationships, Saturn in the 7th house can be actually a really good placement. This can give unions that will last long and prosper by time; of course if aspects from other planets do not indicate the opposite. Both business partners will see this union very professionally and dedicate a lot of hard work which will bring slow but stable development.\nIn any case, this placement will bring a lot of discipline in all the 7th house matters. It might not lead to love or happiness, but will definitely lead to security- and with this placement this is probably what you are looking for. Of course, commitment is not something to play with; you will need to dedicate yourself and work hard for your unions to function, but Saturn is a planet that rewards hard work. Before you do anything, put your needs on a scale and understand what you really want. After all, we re talking about the 7th house, and it is ruled by Libra, so weigh on her scales your priorities.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:57:49'),
(1550, 0, 'us', 'saturn-in-4th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving Saturn in the house of one’s home is a rather difficult natal placement. The 4th house is traditionally ruled by Cancer and the Moon, and Saturn’s cold presence is adversely affecting all the emotional areas connected with one’s home, family and childhood. Even when Saturn is well-aspected, it will still bring coldness in the native’s family affairs even when his parents do not treat him in a bad way; they might just be very old, conservative and become a burden because he must take care of them.\nUsually, Saturn in the 4th house brings an unhappy childhood. As the 4th house is ruling the native’s mother, she is frequently distant and cold. This placement gives possibilities of an old mother of a rather melancholic character, whose culture and approach towards life is rather serious. The native while an infant does not receive tenderness and feels unloved. When Mars or Pluto are present with hard aspects to the natal Saturn, or inside the 4th house forming a stellium, the native can have even suffered abuse from his mother or both parents. In any case, the native’s emotional needs not fulfilled, making his home surroundings a rather restrictive place in his mind. \n \n\n\nWhen Saturn is well-aspected, the person’s parents can be involved in a lot of responsibilities, being frequently absent from the child’s life. An older person, maybe grandmother or grandfather can be the one who raises the child, and gives a lot less love than the young native needs to blossom. In some situations, this placement can create orphans that are being kept under the responsibility of an older parental figure. In other situations the family might be struggling financially, which brings a general difficult and miserable atmosphere at home\nThe native has a hard time expressing his own affection towards his family; the family might be rather conservative and frowning upon expressions of love, happiness and joy. Usually, there can be seen a motive passing through generations- the grandparents and the grand-grandparents were also strict and unloving to their own children. The native with such a placement should be very careful to not continue this pattern towards his own offsprings.\nDuring a Saturn return, which happens around the 28th-30th year of the native, he might be stuck for a year or two in taking care of an older person of his family. This might be a very difficult period, as the older person might have severe health problems and it definitely restricts the native’s life. The period feels like being in a jail, as there is not a lot of time left for recreational activities and can bring a lot of melancholy. If you have such a placement, you are strongly advised to carry this burden of taking care of the old person, as it is a karmic debt. In case that you do not do that, then your second Saturn return in your 58-60 years will be rather harsh; it might even signify a prolonged period of a difficult old age for you. \n \n\n\nThe difficulties concerning the native’s family situations are frequently influencing him to not create a family of his own. Family can be regarded as something overly restrictive, and the person will definitely at least consider escaping this life direction.\nHave in mind that this aspect and the result it brings are sometimes even an outcome of the native’s subjective view on things. His own perception influences the way he sees his family, and even if his family does love him he feels the opposite. There might be tendencies of loneliness and as a child he feels that his parents do not understand him. Many times, this can be caused by a big difference in age between him and his parents. The parents might be trying to show him love in an old fashioned way, while the native observes how other parents treats their children and considers he is lacking such type of an affection.\nIn addition, Saturn in the 4th house can bring delays and disappointments in everything that is connected with property. In case that the native receives a property as an inheritance, he might be having trouble to get it and use it, while also this building might be very old and need renovation- making his usage uncertain. Also, selling property can manifest problematically; there might be little interest of buyers or the condition of the buildings will be something that repels them. On the other hand, if Saturn is very positively aspected by Venus or/and Jupiter, it can bring a very important old building as a heritage. There is still possibility of it being dysfunctional, but at least it can be something of historical or even financial value. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:58:00'),
(1551, 0, 'us', 'venus-in-11th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWith natal Venus in the 11th house, the chart owner receives quite a lot of blessings from the planet concerning his social activities and friends. This placement is wonderful for giving and taking love and affection from various groups of people, makes the native highly liked and even the heart of a company.\nVenus will bring quite a large amount of friends and acquaintances and the person with such an aspect is an extrovert and very outgoing. All group activities flow in a harmonious way, giving him a lot of pleasure and making him be the center of attention. Venus is indicating flirting through groups of people, which will often also bring lovers who were previously friends. In case that the 7th house cusp is in Taurus or Libra, the native’s marriage partner will first be a friend for some time.\nAn 11th house Venus will make the native have friends of an artistic nature, many of them being musicians or other types of performers. In addition, this also signifies friends that work with beauty products; beauty and fashion is even becoming a central theme of conversations that can blend the group itself.\nDue to the fact that the 11th house is opposing the 5th, which is ruling love, an individual with such an aspect will frequently prefer his friends over his lovers. In case there is some malefic planet in the fifth house directly opposing natal Venus, this placement can make various problems arise between the native’s friends and relationships. His lovers will be usually upset by the amount of time he dedicates to other people, and frequently feeling abandoned. This can lead to hostile actions towards his friends, especially if the planet placed in the fifth house is Mars or Pluto.\nVenus placed in the house of group activity can greatly aid in all matters concerning organizations. The native will probably belong to at least one social community or club, and will be considered a vital part of it. Venus alone does not bring leadership, yet this can also happen if it is supported by Jupiter, Pluto or Mars. Usually, the native dedicates his attention to passing his time well through such organizations and does not have any particular inner need of receiving an authority position. \n \n\n\nAn adversely aspected Venus is making the individual rather careless with the friends he chooses, as he rushes to embrace all the people he meets as acquaintances. If Venus is ill-aspected by Mars or Pluto, problems can arise in those groups due to erotic reasons. The native may create awkward situations by dating people from the same group, which of course will have a rather turbulent effect. Nevertheless, the natural politeness of planet Venus will resolve such issues sooner or later. \n \n\n\nThe 11th house is also referring to help received from friends, and Venus placed here will definitely bring a lot of it. Many of the friends may be quite wealthy and will provide the native all the necessary aid. In case that Venus is very positively aspected, especially by Uranus or Jupiter, the native can become very rich through a friend. The friend may want to share his wealth with the native, or elsehow find some way so that the individual reaches financial prosperity.\nIn a man’s chart, such a natal position of Venus indicates a lot of female friends and very good relations towards the opposite gender. As the 11th house is traditionally ruled by Aquarius and Uranus, planet Venus is receiving rather alternative Vibes and becomes quite altruistic and eccentric. The native’s affection may be of a “multitask” nature, as he is able to channel feelings of love to more than one person simultaneously. As a natural outcome, such people are more prominent to experience romantic affairs with more than one person at the same period, and can even give tendencies of polyamorism and other forms of liberal affairs. \n \n\n\nThis is an overall pleasant placement, but who would say something different when the benefic planet of Venus is involved? As with all Venusian matters, the only thing one should be careful of is overindulgence. Thus, enjoy your group activities but do not dedicate your life only to them; let your romanticism flow towards the members of such groups but also keep some balances. Not all people are similar-minded and many of them will not understand your perception of human relations.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:58:41');

Such people can rather easily fall in love with their job and will definitely excel in it; Venus is holding the keys to the Saturnian world of work and opens it wide quite easily.\nThe smooth Venusian energy will have a very positive influence on the individual’s profession, mostly helping in job areas where the native is either the master of his own work or even an employer of others. Venus will definitely connect his job with the respective occupations ruled by her; those that contain beauty and harmony. When this benefic planet is present in the tenth, it can lead to professions that involve arts. People with such a placement can excel in the theatre world, in fashion, music or even cosmetology and other products for beauty.\nSuch a natal Venus will bring pleasant working surroundings, helpful co-workers while also harmonic relations with people of authority. The person who is blessed to have the benefic here will love his work, and all his time and efforts are dedicated with a great amount of passion. The individual will never be tired or bored while working, as his occupation is a way to externalize his love. In addition, a lot of doors will open to the native just because of his beauty and charm; he definitely has what it takes to be accepted as a positive presence and will deal better than most others in interviews and similar filtering activities. \n \n\n\nThe 10th house is ruling the native’s more dominant parent, which usually is the father. Venus here makes the parent have a Taurus/Libra emphasis in the natal chart, or elsehow a very strong Venus. This placement usually gives smooth relations with the parent, and can frequently indicate that he is an artist or otherwise a public figure. \n \n\n\nVenus in the tenth tends to attract romance through work, and if the 7th house cusp is located in Taurus or Libra a marriage with a co-worker or business partner is very possible. Also, as the 10th house is traditionally ruled by Saturn and Capricorn, Venus placed in his realm may indicate attraction to older individuals, who many times can be in an employer/boss position or elsehow influence the native as a mentor and not only a lover. Another situation that can frequently appear is getting married with the work itself; the person may not need a significant other as he can reach fullness and equilibrium by evolving himself as an organism through what he does for a living. \n \n\n\nThis placement gifts a lot of charm to the native, and even masses can accept his image and bliss quite easily. If Venus is strongly supported by other planets, the whole formation is an indicator of fame. The native’s public image may be strongly enhanced through artistic filters, he is very photogenic and when appears on screen is often looking even more beautiful than he really is. The public will quickly admire and love his image, and any attempts of creating a “fan club” can be highly successful. Such an individual knows better than anyone how to play with his appearance and seduce the cameras and lenses.\nWhen natal Venus is in the tenth, there can be great abilities of public relation, and appearing in front of an audience produces positive effects. The native has the gift of diplomacy and knows how to use his words, gestures and appearance in order to magnetize the audience. The people might pay a lot more attention to how the native appears and acts in front of them, than what he is promoting to them. Thus, people with such a natal placement are frequently used by groups and organizations of a dubious nature, in order to present a false and positive image of the otherwise suspicious activities they indulge in. Usually, the native will know the big picture and consciously accept this role; especially an adversely aspected Venus will grant the nature a flexible morality towards such roles. After all, for him it is just a job; being on stage for his employers and renting them his image.\nFinally, a tenth house Venus will make sure that the native will choose the best clothes for his job. He will usually spend a lot of money when deciding what to wear and his appearance will be further enhanced by the preferred style. He has strong insights of what is modern and will keep up with fashion, usually being of the first to foresee a new trend current- and of course implementing it in his reality. Other people can be easily influenced by what he wears and copy his style.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 06:58:52'),

He will adore foreign languages and possibly learn more than one, while also be fascinated by foreign culture and religions. Such people will spend a lot of time reading about traditions spirituality, getting connected through books with foreign philosophies. Their love for anything exotic will eventually help them travel a lot, while also gaining a lot from this activity. The possible gains are not only financial; in fact such gifts will be granted by Venus only if it is somehow connected with the 2nd or 8th house by sign. Depending on which house cusps are located in the signs of Taurus and Libra, you will understand the life areas that will be benefited from this natal placement of Venus. People with this natal placement adore geography from their young age, and will frequently pass time studying encyclopedias, maps or watching documentaries about our planet.\nThere are high possibilities of the native finding love abroad; Venus tends to bring attraction towards exotic people and in some cases even marriage to a foreigner. This is sure to happen if the cusp of the 7th house is located in Venus or Libra. People of different cultural backgrounds will be strongly attracted to the native too; he will feel a lot more popular than in his own country. This placement gives kind in-laws, who will give a lot of love to the native and have balanced relations with him. \n \n\n\nNatal Venus in the 9th house is an indicator of writing and publishing. Individuals with such a placement will indulge in this activity with a lot of passion and love. Venus may urge the native write romantic literature, or generally create very artistic writings full of atmosphere. In case that Venus is residing in Leo, the native will write theater plays or movie scripts. The native will have a very rich vocabulary and people will love reading or listening to him. He can also become a travel writer or elsehow involved in publishing about matters of geography, cultures or religions.\nWhile Venus placed in the ninth house is usually bringing higher education, it can make the person quite lazy and prolong the time he will study. For him, the surroundings of a university will bring a lot of fun and pleasure, making concentrating on the subjects quite difficult. People with this placement may indulge in a very active student life, full of parties and leisure activities.\nIn case that Venus is negatively aspected there are possibilities of never finishing his studies; nevertheless the things he will gain through any type of activities connected with his university will aid him a lot. Sometimes, it is not the diploma that counts in success; such a native may have an even more important asset to help him in his career. This would be the experiences he gained through blending with groups of students, good friendships and a broader sense of knowledge than a graduation paper can offer. Of course, this does not mean he will never graduate, and even if this happens it might be his conscious choice. \n \n\n\nVenus in the ninth gives a great respect to the ceremonies and arts of various religions. The native may read a lot about them, travel to take part in different rituals and later publish books about his philosophic views on them. Eventually, they will choose one certain country or culture and fall in love with it, making it the epicenter of their attention. They become deeply connected with the collective soul of the foreign nation, and will usually relocate- at least for a period of some years.\nEven if Venus is adversely aspected, it will still function well in the house traditionally ruled by Jupiter and Sagittarius. The blending of the two benefics planets’ energies will always create positive outcomes in the life of the individual. Nevertheless, hard aspects to the native’s Venus might initially give him a lot of escapism traits. His first steps towards discovering the world around him will be a general dissatisfaction with the everyday reality he experiences in his own place. This can be highly disturbing, especially during his young ages where a lot of restrictions are usually present.

And indeed, people with such a placement are dreaming of a marriage since their young years. Generally, such natives dislike being on their own and will always prefer the security of a relationship, probably being involved in good ones during their life. Yet, when they find the correct person to become a life partner, they can commit without any problems; if Venus is well-aspected it indicates a long lasting love even after the wedding. When Venus is adversely aspected the spouse can be lazy and passive; nevertheless this is not a real problem as love is a lot more important than such habits.\r\n\r\nThe wedding of the individual will be a rather expensive event. Venus in the 7th house indicates a lot of money spent on the ceremony, which will involve a lot of people and will be generally regarded as phantasmagoric. The native will buy an expensive suit or wedding dress; have a majestic wedding cake and excellent food. This once-in-a-lifetime experience will make the couple shine as if in a fairy tale. Of course, in case that Venus is adversely aspected, this overspending will have negative effects on other areas of the native’s life. It is quite easy to understand which areas will be challenged through observing the placement of the planets that have squares or oppositions to natal Venus.\r\n\r\nThe gifts of Venus do not stop here; this natal placement is wonderful for any type of business partnerships.

His business partners are also becoming his friends, and the atmosphere surrounding their job is very pleasant. In addition, Venus favors all kinds of contracts, while also will bring victories in any law disputes that may appear. This natal placement is great for dealing with the public; it promotes a good public image and thus is prominent in people who are occupied in PR.\r\n\r\nA seventh-house Venus is an optimist, concerning how he views his partners. The negative traits are ignored while the positive are magnified; this can indeed create a false view but definitely bonds the two individuals stronger. With natal Venus in the 7th house, the native both gives and receives tenderness and respect, which in turn empower both people’s self-confidence. The couple progresses together, and is not enemies that have something to divide but rather allies helping each other.\r\n\r\nAn afflicted Venus in the 7th house can bring delays in marriage, especially if by Saturn. Adverse aspects of Venus to Jupiter will make the spouse a procrastinating person, adoring all types of luxuries and overindulgences. Squares and oppositions by Mars or Neptune might indicate a fake image of the spouse, which can be of a rather promiscuous nature and a good liar; nevertheless even these aspects do not mean there will be a lack of balance in their marital life.\r\n\r\nWhen planet Venus is examined, few advices can be given due to the positive traits that this planet usually gives. As it is directly connected with pleasure and happiness, the native should strive to dive into the gifts it offers.

School was a great and fun experience, and it was quite easy to learn everything that was taught. The child did not need to invest a lot of time in learning, as the information provided was easily absorbed by the young mind. Language learning was one of the most interesting things, and the native will probably learn quite a lot of them during his life. Again, he has an advantage compared to other individuals as he needs to invest less effort than others would do.<br />\nWhen Mercury is also present in the house, it can create a good writer; if Venus is part of a stellium of planets residing in the house then the native has enormous abilities of creating nearly anything artistic. The presence of Uranus conjuncting Venus will furthermore enhance the mind and expression, creating a genius whose artistic work might be pioneering. Venus placed in the third gives a great talent for poetry, while can also affect the native’s love life positively: communication will play a great role and he will indulge in writing beautiful love letters. Such natives are developing passion for books, magazines and any other form of written information, which they literally drink; in extreme situations this placement can even create information-addicts that cannot feel comfortable unless there constantly exist sources of information around them. They always need a book, a computer or their telephone present, and not having internet available is something that will definitely irritate them. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nVenus in the third house does not like loud music, sharp noises and the sounds of the city; the individual will travel a lot of short distance trips to relax, and this will often be a vital part of his reality. They love walking in parks, nearby forests and nature in general, seeking inspiration in calm and beautiful parts of their city or the outskirts.

They do not like arguing because high tones of voice are ruining their harmonic state of mind. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAs the third house is ruling siblings, Venus tends to give a pleasant brother or sister with which a wonderful relationship is established from a very young age. The sibling is a charmer, having a lot of affairs and general luck in love, unless there are very hard aspects from Mars, Pluto or Uranus to Venus. It is probable that the sibling is also involved in some type of artistic activity, or something connected of beauty. This could be even working as a hairdresser, or in a clothes shop, beauty products or PR.

When Venus is located in the 1st house, the house of the self, its effects can be noticed not only in the native’s life but also on his body and general appearance.<br />\nHaving Venus, the planet of beauty, in the 1st house is an indicator of an attractive and charming person. If the planet is not receiving a lot of challenging aspects, the native is kind-hearted and diplomatic, a tender soul that easily attracts other individuals. It tends to give a lot of physical beauty, a great sense of style in clothes and manners, and the native dedicates a lot of time on his body and appearance. When Venus is positively aspecting Mars or in Aries, the body is not only beautiful but also athletic and the native will spend a lot of time on physical exercise to keep a good shape which usually lasts till his later years.<br />\nVenus is a feminine planet, and thus the women that have such a placement are definitely of the most attractive. This occurs no matter in which sign it is placed, but the sign definitely has an influence on what type of beauty the native has. Frequently other people will be copying the native’s clothes style and he will be of the first to catch new waves of fashion. If Venus is forming an aspect with Uranus or is positioned in Aquarius, then the style would be rather eccentric and bizarre. When the native is a man, Venus might give him some feminine characteristics; yet this has little to do with his sexual orientation. In fact, when Venus is located in a man’s first house, he could easily be a womanizer. The more hard aspects Venus is receiving, the more self-indulgent the man would be. His natural charm can make him a firefly in the eyes of women, and if Venus is in a square or opposition with Pluto then he should get prepared to receive obsessive behaviors from them, a lot of jealousy that can even reach stalking. In case that Scorpio is also involved, the effects of such type of feelings and situations will be even stronger. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLove and affection is a priority for the people with such a placement, and they prefer to be in some kind of a relationship all the time. They like to feel attractive, enjoy compliments and having a significant other fulfils their internal needs. They are usually in love with themselves, and can sometimes even use other people as a mirror, to shine towards them so that their own rays of love return to themselves. This is mostly done subconsciously, and usually does not harm either the native or their partners, unless difficult squares, oppositions and conjunctions with Pluto exist.<br />\nA problem that can appear when Venus is adversely aspected, is inability to perceive their own beauty. The native might be very attractive but concentrating on small details that he does not like. Thus, there is possibility of general worry about their appearance and constant frustration, which can lead to extreme decisions and even mental diseases such as anorexia. Of course, most people with difficult aspects to a 1sthouse Venus just tend to mumble about parts of their body that they dislike.<br />\nThe natives are fond of art and beauty and enjoy everything that falls in this category. They like to please and be pleased by delicate atmosphere and beautiful material objects, and frequently will spend a lot on enjoying artistic performances or obtaining objects of beauty. They love to decorate their room and house artistically, but even more time and money they invest in what they wear. Their way of speaking and approaching others is also very gentle and polite, and they follow the social protocols that make other individuals open up towards them very easily.<br />\nPeople with Venus in their 1st house are very diplomatic and can easily reach compromise. Thus, if the cusps of the 6th or 10th house are located either in Taurus or in Libra, their personal charm and skills can be of great power in a job that needs such a physical appearance. People with such a natal placement can succeed in any type of jobs that involve their physical presence for the sale, such as real estate. Also, they are great for negotiations with other companies, as their presence can influence the outcome on their side.<br />\nEven if Venus grants all the gifts mentioned, the native some times does not realize the blessing he has. It is frequent for them to have a low self esteem, or high standards for themselves, and when they understand that they fail to reach their own standards they can become passive-aggressive. They want to be liked by everyone, and this makes them quite vulnerable, as there will be always someone that will not like them. Unfortunately, they would constantly concentrate on that one instead of looking the reactions of all the rest, which in the end makes them unhappy. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIf Venus is in Pisces, or aspecting Neptune, the native can get in big delusions and self deception in his life. His perception of himself is largely dependant on his likes and dislikes, and a very common phenomenon is to see the world through some artificial lenses that do not at all correspond with reality. On the other hand, this might not be totally negative, as the native can build his own beautiful world and live in it happily; this will mostly happen when Venus is trining or sextiling Neptune. In any case, most people with Venus in the 1st house are narcissists. Some less, some more, but the seed of self-adoration is always present and ready to bloom. But, what else would we expect from Venus, the Goddess of beauty and love? <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe more close Venus is located to the Ascendant, the more effect will her beautiful rays have on the body of the native. The further from the Ascendant, the more effect she will be having on the image, the clothes and the belongings. This happens because the Ascendant is responsible for the physical appearance and the body, while the second house for material belongings.

The 8th house is among others the house of death and sex, a gate to the occult world and strongly connected with other people’s money. Naturally, when the gentle light of Venus illuminates such a dark house, all of the above are receiving a pleasant and even artistic hue.<br />\n8th house Venusians have deep and intense emotions. For them, sex is not just a physical activity, but carries all forms of art on it. They are operating in highly sexual octaves, which even depicts in the way they behave in bed. Sex for them is a dance of two opposites, which can even manifest in material reality, as their bodies often express themselves through dance in their private moments. The act of sex can indeed become a spectacle for the eyes of their partner, especially if Venus is in Leo, the sign that governs theatrical acts. This of course is not the only occasion; the presence of Neptune in the same house or in aspect to Venus can give the same seductive and artistic effects to their sexuality.<br />\nVenus is the planet of love and attraction. Thus, it is natural that natives with such placements desire deep relationships and soul bonding. The 8th house rules sex, but not the casual type that is mostly done for fun. Casual sex is more an issue of the 5th house, which is responsible for all small happiness moments and joy. The 8th house is strongly connected to the unconscious levels of the person, and thus sex represented here is of a deeper kind, the one that blends and bonds, creates soul-to-soul love relationships, and breaks down the borders of the ego.<br />\nVenus in the 8th brings the ability of deep and intense emotions; on the other hand this can easily create a jealous personality. When Pluto is also present in the house, or in adverse aspect to Venus, the native can be of obsessive nature. This is even more frequent when Scorpio lays at the cusp of the 8th house; in such a situation the person’s jealousy can reach dangerous levels. When the Moon is also forming a difficult aspect with the two, moodiness and unpredictable behaviors due to its quick movement in the zodiac cycle can bring a lot of turbulence in the person’s emotional life. Possessiveness can be totally out of control, leading the person to extreme actions of despair when he feels that his love life is threatened.<br />\nIt is very common for such natives to have zero patience with partners that do not grant them a feeling of emotional, bodily and material pleasure. Casual affairs are simply not for them, and act just as a substitute until a proper partner is found.<br />\nThe 8th house is also responsible for inheritance, and the spouse’s money. Thus, people with this native placement can receive big wealth, especially if Venus is well aspected by Jupiter or by other benefices. Otherwise, it at least can give a good financial situation of the husband or wife, which grants to the natal chart owner a good joint income. Together with this financial gain, comes a raise in one’s social status. Usually such kind of changes are indicated by the passage of a slow moving planet, many times activated through a triangle transit. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHaving Venus in the house of death, can bring a very pleasant ending to one’s life. It is often peaceful, in beautiful surroundings, giving happy last moments with people they love. This pattern can even signify closing your eyes in the arms of your beloved person. On the other hand, if Venus is very badly aspected by malefics, there are even possibilities of dramatic losses in love. This does not has to be a physical loss, but rather a symbolical one, where the adored partner either abandons the owner of the chart, or seizes to have the love role that he once used to have. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThose who are born with this placement, have a natural charm that sexually attracts large numbers of people. Many people would not even understand what is that which pulls them towards the native, because Venus is hiding in the depths of this mysterious house. Even if the person is not physically attractive, he will see that there exists some strange kind of magnetism from him towards others, running below the surface.<br />\nThe warm light of Venus is casting dancing shades on the dark walls of the house, and so whatever is taboo and forbidden for other people can be normal and desired by such a person. Death itself seizes to be a fearful enemy. It can be transformed into art, and should an artist have this placement then his creations will have a morbid yet gentle outlook. In addition, the partners preferred by them are those with a dangerous aura, oozing mystery and darkness. They need them to be irresistible, seductive, and preferably wealthy money is an aphrodisiac for such kind of people and luxury appeals them a lot. There is high possibility of attraction towards personalities that are engaged in occult work. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nOne subjects that the natives with a 8th house Venus should be careful of is being manipulative. By seeing how easy it is for them to attract people like bees to honey, they tend to use them for their purposes. Self-control in this, and also in jealousy issues, will grant the owner of the chart a better functioning 8th house and enhance the energy of Venus. By checking which house cusps fall into Taurus and Libra, one can see which other sectors of his life will be strengthened if Venus energy is channelled in a good way. Also, over-indulging in other people’s money can become a problem, because an 8th house Venus can get used to their presence easily and take them for granted.<br />\nAnother way to let the energy of Venus flow harmonically, is to concentrate on dancing, theatre and other performances of the body and soul. Thus, both libido and self-love will be heightened, and if one has other important planets placed in houses responsible for profession, a career in these is very probable. Even if one is not interested in making it a life job, performing as a hobby can grant the balance needed in his everyday reality. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:04:51');

By saying dark side, ones’ mind should not go to anything negative. The dark side implied here is mostly what the person does not know about himself, or hides from the world. The subconscious, the unconscious are also a part of the twelfth house, as a terra incognita which most people cannot fully explore or understand in themselves. The twelfth house also rules everything that suppresses the native and whatever has to do with confinement. It is the house of fears and occultism, and the warm Venusian light can have a deep impact on the persons psyche, mostly beneficial. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAs the 12th house is responsible for solitude, the native enjoys having his privacy, being occupied with his own hobbies and interests and even not speaking about them. This would not happen due to some special reason, other than the love to keep some things strictly to one’s self. When Venus is in aspect with other planets responsible for art or creation, the native can even have as a secret hobby creating art, and not sharing it with the world – maybe only with very special people for his soul. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nVenus in the 12th house can make materialism and possessions seem guilty to the person. It is not uncommon that such a native feels shame to show off his belongings, activities or self indulgent tendencies, while at the same time dedicating a lot of time and wealth in obtaining them. There can appear obsessive shopping patterns, especially when Venus is with any aspect to Pluto or Jupiter, while the native afterwards acrobats between feelings of happiness and guilt. This type of actions can also stimulate his eroticism, as can also secret presents from lovers, especially if they are involved in illegal or unconditional affairs. A love for sugar and candies can also be present, again wrapped in a feeling of guilt and secrecy.<br />\nPeople that have Venus placed in the secret 12th house, are always tending to develop hidden love affairs. This does not necessarily mean that they should be illegal, but mostly that they prefer to hold them away from the eyes of the community. Of course, illegal affairs can also be present, and if Venus is negatively aspected with Mars, Uranus or Pluto, the native should be very careful because such kind of aspects usually lead to dramatic consequences. The affair can be either uncovered, or problems of jealousy can appear. Both the native and the lovers he attracts can be of a dramatic nature, with frequent scenes of quarrel and intense emotions. Of course, this on the other hand can bring very intense sexual relationships; the pattern of love/hate relations is frequent to appear.<br />\nThe 12th house Venusian has artistic abilities; nevertheless most times he is afraid to exhibit his work. He does not believe so much in his power, while he spends more time in fantasizing a life of an artist rather than dedicating time and effort of becoming one. There is definite presence of potential, but unless supported by other planets the results would be mediocre. Even if the native creates great art, he tends to underestimate his chances of success, and not a lot of effort is put in promoting them inside the system; the person prefers to daydream about possibilities that could happen, while the creations are being left in a drawer or in a closet.<br />\nVenus in the 12th adversely aspected can signify indulgence with alcohol or drugs, which can also be hidden from all the nearby people. Alternatively, it would attract lovers with such kind of problems, which could also start spreading to the owner of the chart. This does not necessarily involve substance problems and getting addicted, but even nurturing the significant other and being near him while he is in trouble can definitely be an issue for the native itself. Such a placement can easily make the chart owner to get lost in love and finding it difficult to keep his own identity while being with his partner. This can let people take advantage of the native, especially when he is feeling loved. During the native’s childhood, love as a concept could have been criminalized by the surroundings. Thus, the person has linked affection and love with being forbidden or immoral, and it is this exact way of thinking that makes him to tend towards hiding his emotions and keeping his private life away from the lights of the community.<br />\nIf Venus is located near the Ascendant, it starts projecting itself into the first house too, having an effect at the same time on the body of the native. Venus tends to give a lot of beauty and harmonic physical appearance, with the colors of skin and hair tending to be smooth and light, brownish or sometimes blonde. There is a big possibility of being victims of stalking and obsession, as Venus projected through the Ascendant can be quite vulnerable in this subject. Other people can clearly see the Venusian physical characteristics of the native, and if hard synastry aspects with Mars or Pluto are awakened then the body can become a target of obsessive behavior. Of course, this can be better observed by the overall condition of Venus, but in case there are natal indicators in the native’s chart about this subject, the smartest thing is to be careful of people with obsessive characters. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIf someone has a 12th house Venus, it is quite possible that he is unaware both of his beauty and of the impact that this might have on other people. The 12th house is a blind spot, it is the things that we have inside us and cannot quite understand because we are looking outside. Furthermore, this tendency can be created because of lack of nurturing during the childhood; the parents might have not paid attention to make the child feel beautiful and understand its beauty – and the concept of beauty generally. Thus, when reaching an adult age, the 12th house still remains a blind spot, making the native have wrong perception of his own beauty. Furthermore, as the 12th house is traditionally ruled by Neptune, the effect it creates when materializing is an ethereal type of beauty, which is promising even if not apparent. This can attract through osmosis all type of people, who are intrigued by the idea to uncover what exactly makes the native beautiful and understand this subconscious attraction that it creates. Of course, psychic vampires are also to be of the first to be attracted as the native is a usually an easy victim- unless its 12 house is supported by aspect or planets that indicate protection.<br />\nThere are possibilities of offering voluntary work in institutions, as the house is also governing all places of confinement. With Venus placed there, the volunteering will be done with happiness and care and the native will enjoy it. As Venus is a quick moving planet, this would rather be a short-timed occupation, lasting usually a semester before it appears again as a pattern. The placement could also signify passing time with a dear person that has a sickness or difficulties in taking care of his own self, and usually also does not last longer than some months. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:04:56'),

Their mind is structured in such a way that they simply know how to make money, and can easily find windows in the system to grab and get them.<br />\nUsually, this ability is developed through reading a lot; such individuals will spend a lot of time and money on books, software, tutorials and education. They are able to thoroughly analyze the data they receive, and are excellent in anything that has to do with numbers. They can become great accountants; if Mercury is afflicted then there are possibilities of them using their powers in a mischievous way. A Mercurian mind can find how to use the system for their benefit, and will not hesitate indulging into economic fraud, if the chances of being caught are low. After all, the Greek God Hermes (Latin Mercury) was also the god-protector of thieves. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPeople with Mercury in the house of possessions, can gain a lot of money through stocks, as they have great intuition about when to buy and when to sell. In case that Mercury is somehow connected to the 5th house by sign rulership or by a trine aspect to some planet, then he will have success in any kind of speculative profession. This aspect brings dangers of becoming a sheer materialist, and the native is strongly advised to also invest his time on spiritual pursuits, otherwise his whole life will not have any higher purpose than material success.<br />\nAs Mercury is the planet of communications, people who have the planet placed in the 2nd house are very good in making money through the phone, the internet or generally through their written or spoken words. They have a great memory, which helps them organize the amassed knowledge and experience in their minds. Their brain is a well-working computer which becomes better and better, through upgrading its software and algorithms during the passage of time. In many situations, the answers to problems in their business are already inside their head m they do not need the help of others. For them, business is an interesting puzzle waiting to be resolved, and a great amount of time will be invested in this purpose. Even when they are adults, they feel happy like children when finding the right way to solve their career riddles. They must always be careful to not become egoistic, spoiled adults, that care only about these riddles.<br />\nPeople with Mercury in the 2nd house are the category that least suffers from unemployment. Their rapid mind can always find a solution about what to do to earn money, and many times creates a safety net for their income. Except from having a regular job, such a native will many times have one or more minor jobs- both to support his monthly paycheck and to have a small income during transitional periods between careers. When someone has this aspect, it is quite probable he will own one or more websites on the internet and generally be involved in e-commerce; even if this will be just receiving money from advertisements.<br />\nMercury in the second house creates a mathematic mind, able to structure words and music into beautiful formations. There might be tendencies of writing music or poetry; their arts are following the fractal rules of nature and do not like asymmetry. Self-identification and self-esteem are tightly bonded to his thoughts; he is what he thinks. His most precious second house asset is not the money he can earn, but actually the system he develops for earning them. Such a native will be utterly proud of this, and may be constantly talking and showing off about it.<br />\nIf there exists a trine to planets located in the 9th house, the individual might teach others his ways of working. This could be either through writing books, or through seminars. Of course, if this happens then the aspect triggers even more the second house Mercury, bringing even bigger income to the native. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nEven if their Mercury is poorly aspected, they still can be great in what they do. The effort they put might be the same, but they will be not assisted by luck, making them need more time to accomplish their goals. They should also be very careful with legal contracts and business partnerships, as an afflicted Mercury can bring a lot of problems with whatever is written in paper. It will be a pity to succeed financially, but lose what they earned due to wrong papers or being swindled by a business partner. In any situation, if you have Mercury in the second house try to not over focus on money. They will eventually come to your life, probably be constantly coming, but there are a lot more things out there to focus on. A world also exists outside your head, your room, your computer and your bank account!

(1564, 0, 'us', 'mercury-in-1st-house', 5, '<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\nMercury is the planet of intelligence, and when located in the first house of the native will create a very communicative character. They have a very quick-thinking mind, are very talkative and enjoy writing, reading and anything that contains information and speech. Expressing themselves is the most important thing in their lives, and their natural curiosity can lead them amassing huge amounts of information in their minds. Their life is all about learning; they don’t stop till their very last day. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPeople with Mercury positioned in the house of self, like riddles, puzzles and everything that keeps their mind alert. They are many times interested in uncovering mysteries of the world and life. This can draw them either into studying science, or into studying the supernatural. If Mercury is somehow connected to the 6th or the 10th house, the individual might follow a scientific occupation, while if it is connected to some planet located in the 9th there are possibilities of an academic work, teaching or publishing. Their mind is processing data quicker than the average person, and they have a quicker tempo of learning.<br />\nMercury placed near the Ascendant usually gives a short and quick body, small eyes and an expressive face. If Mercury is adversely aspected, there might exist speech problems such as dyslexia. What they think and what they express determines their self-existence. This makes them pay a lot of attention to how other people say and express, making the hyper-analytical. This can many times annoy other people, as they will constantly feel being observed and judged by the first house Mercury person. Another tendency such natives have is speaking a lot, asking a lot and an inability to keep secrets. When Mercury turns retrograde, their speech can become clumsy, bringing them trouble through misunderstandings and other types of miscommunication. As children they tend to be hype-energetic, while also capable of doing two or more things at the same time. Just sitting still and relaxing is not an option for them; their mind craves for something interesting to kill boredom. If Mercury is connected to Jupiter with a positive aspect, they can become great comedians. If it is connected with Pluto, they have great discovery abilities; this placement is prominent in detectives and researchers of any kind. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nA problematic behavior that can appear to such natives is not allowing others to express. Indeed, such kind of people can talk for hours, forgetting that the people around them have equal rights in expression. This is not done on purpose; the native just forgets to stop talking. Being at the center of attention is rather a sweet position, but it also good listening the other people once in a while. Debates might be very appealing for such kind of individuals; nevertheless they should be fair as they have the tendency to defend their views even when they know they are wrong- just so that they feel victorious.<br />\nWhen Mercury has some tough aspect with Mars, natives have a mischievous nature. Their highly intelligent and alert brain is used as a tool for swindling, or even stealing. They understand that the speed of their thought is something difficult for others to follow, and they are usually three steps ahead in their thinking, making their insincere strategies frequently succeed. These kinds of tactics are of course destroying their karma, and should be avoided. Some transit of a slow-moving malefic might rebalance the negative karma attracted to Mercury, and usually the lesson to be learnt is not a pleasant one. Instead, such wonderful minds as theirs should be used for the enlightment of the humanity. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:06:26'),
(1565, 0, 'us', 'mercury-in-7th-house', 5, '<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\nHaving the natal Mercury in the 7th house has a strong effect on marriage, contracts, unions and all other areas ruled by this angular house. Mercury, being the planet of communication, gives a rather intellectual background to all these, and partnerships of all types are usually based on excessive mutual flow of information. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe native with such a placement has a strong urge for communication with his partner, and would choose a good speaker and listener to share his time and everyday routine. Conversations are having a stimulating effect on the couple, and it would create the person that is constantly on the phone or texting the significant other even when they are away. In case the seventh house cusp is in the signs of Virgo or Gemini, the effects of Mercury are furthermore empowered, and the partnership will be constantly growing through new ideas and perspectives.<br />\nAs the seventh house is also ruling official business partnerships, Mercury placed there can be very helpful in cooperation. Usually, planets occupying the 7th house bring close collaborations, established by contracts or other bonds that are hard to break. Mercury makes the bond be thoroughly planned and with emphasis on the details, while the job itself is either connected in some way with communication, or involves a lot of interconnection between the two sides.<br />\nIn case that the native’s natal Mercury is retrograde, the placement would complicate a little bit the house’s issues, leading to over-analyzing the relationships and marriage. The person tends to concentrate on the details, forgetting that the big picture is what matters. This would in particular happen when Mars or Uranus are also placed in the house; in such a situation aggression is easy to rise between the couple or the business partners, and sudden breaking of the marriage or contracts is also frequent.<br />\nThe same kind of disturbance in the relations can be felt when transiting Mercury is turning retrograde, due to the fact that he tends to make the lines of communication go down. Mercury is retrograding roughly three times a year, for a period of around 20 days, and the effects are mostly nervousness and misunderstanding. Of course, the quick tempo of Mercurial transits makes these patterns temporary, unless supported by a difficult transit of some slow-moving malefic. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe people attracted as business partners or spouses are usually having heavily emphasized Virgo or Gemini in their charts, or a strong Mercury by placement. The marriage tends to be to a younger person, who usually has a quite strong intellectual background through studying. Mercury is a neither masculine nor feminine, thus bringing the marriage having a rather non-sexual approach. This by no means that physical activities will not be present, but it rather emphasizes on the spiritual and intellectual side of the bonding. Communication will always be more important than sex, and the mind will be prevailing in front of the body. After all, even the choice of the significant other will be decided with the criteria of mind-compatibility, thus giving chances of not choosing the most sexually compatible body as a partner.<br />\nFurthermore, it should be mentioned that the dual nature of Mercury can make the house of commitment be activated more than once. Two marriages or long term relationships are quite possible, while the pattern of having to choose between two people and generally being in dilemmas can also appear. In any case, Mercury as the planet of intellect will give the native the ability to analyze the situations, and mostly choose with logic his path. A strong trine by a slow moving planet will support good intuitive decisions and bring luck to the native’s choices of commitment. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe seventh house is also ruling the open enemies of a native, and Mercury residing in it will make the person a good negotiatior, finding ways to compromise with the person that is in front of him. We should not consider the term enemy as someone who wants to cause harm to the person, but rather someone who might have different opinions on subjects that matter both. Thus, indeed a spouse or a business partner can be also regarded as open enemies, as there are frequently issues involving them that seek resolution. Mercury is rather a a good placement for achieving agreements with them, and in case of conjunction with Jupiter, the chart owner has the ability to turn his enemies to friends and supporters. Such a conjunction would turn the marriage or the partnership to a very strong spiritual bond where all sides would grow and be spiritually nurtured from the whole process.<br />\nOne should be careful when his natal Mercury in the 7th house is afflicted by Mars, Uranus or Pluto, as quarreling and arguments can arise in his partnerships. Squares or oppositions with Saturn would cause intellectual loneliness, and finding the right mind to share the native’s reality could be quite difficult. Neptune being present along with Mercury in the house, or Pisces on the house cusp, could even bring a celibate commitment, or a white wedding just for obtaining the paperwork. Furthermore, if there is any adverse aspect with slow-moving malefic, the native should be very careful when putting things on paper, and definitely try to settle out things out of court in case that either the marriage or the business partnership goes down. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLack of adverse aspects usually indicates a non-problematic flow of the 7th house subjects; the presence of beneficial ones empowers it even more. In such circumstances, the seventh house and all it represents becomes a quite central point in the native’s life, upon which everything else is built. In case that you observe your 7th house Mercury receiving a lot of trines and sextiles, then you definitely need a partner to function better. After all, one’s mind is where everything starts from, and through unification and commitment such a person will reach the intellectual surrounding needed for him to function.<br />\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:06:31'),
(1566, 0, 'us', 'mercury-in-11th-house', 5, '<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\nMercury is the planet of intellect, communication, and mental abilities. Being in the 11th house of a natal chart, it strengthens whatever has to do with group interactions, mental companionship, and friendships. In this placement, the native is naturally curious about the structures and functions of groups; this usually leads them to becoming part of such. The person with such a placement is strongly attracted to community affairs, being frequently a member of cultural organizations. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThis lifelong curiosity of discovering human intelligence brings a lot of friends, who frequently come and go as Mercury is a fast moving planet. Especially if Mercury’s position is strengthened by Venus by conjunction, a lot of pleasure and joy comes through one’s friends. There is high possibility of having also the Sun in the same house, because the Sun, Mercury, and Venus are always travelling close one to the other on the celestial trail of the ecliptic. In such an occasion, the native‘s life is illuminated by his friends, and they become an important priority or even his life’s basic factor of stability. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe 9th house Mercurian personality can identify his goals and choose the correct partners to work with. He always tends to join projects that involve more than one person, where collective brainstorming can make the outcome much better than strictly personal work. Teamwork brings pleasure and the anonymity of a group helps his ideas flourish better. In case that Mercury is in a double sign like Gemini or Pisces, the native runs more than one project simultaneously, giving a brilliant mind for parallel thinking.<br />\nWhen Mercury is adversely afflicted, his numerous friends can be chatty, and their loyalty might be under question. This is quite natural to happen, because the amounts of acquaintances and friends can be much bigger than of an average person, and the chart owner pays little attention towards discriminating who of them are quality and who should be avoided. He rather views the mass as a whole, accepting the fact that superficial and dishonest people are naturally part of the mass too. In case that there are very difficult squares with Mars, Uranus or Pluto, the pattern of betrayal by friends is often to be observed. This by no means indicates that the native should stop opening himself towards groups; more attention should be though given to whom he chooses as the closest persons to him.<br />\nIf the 11th house cusp is placed on Aquarius, the person is likely to choose volunteering or other humanitarian roads. This placement makes him an altruist, preferring to sacrifice his personal prosperity over the collective and placing efforts for building a better future society. If the cusp falls on Scorpio, he tends to be a shadier person in the groups, rather focusing on their function and other details than on the image promotion. If  the cusp falls in Aries, the person is very dynamic in fighting for the group’s ideas, dislikes slow processes and is always pushing towards speeding up the decision-making procedures.<br />\nMercury in the 11th house makes the native care a lot about how he appears in other people’s eyes, even though they seem to not be so concerned about their real conditions. This does not happened due to some subconscious need to show off, but rather in the need to blend harmonically with the group and not feel that the eyes are turned towards them due to differences. The 11th house is also responsible for wealth, as is the 2ndand 8th. The difference with the other two houses, is that the 11th is not referring to earned money from everyday activities, nor to joint recourses of other people that the native handles. When we speak about the wealth of the 11th, it is about the big money, the permanent rise that comes once, the luck that will change the person’s life forever. 11th house wealth is activated less frequently, as it is mostly  triggered by external situations and not conscious effort of the native. There has to be a connection between the planets involved in the house, and the ruler planets or/and signs that occupy the 2nd or 8th house, in order of such a wealth rainfall to happen. Mercury here is a positive placement, allowing the native to unexpectedly prosper through publishing or public speech in general. In case of adverse aspects to Mercury, he should be careful of contracts and other legal issues which might cause problems between him and the group. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMercury in the 11th house is a great position for people involved in jobs that have to do with recurring patterns. This would create a great journalist, an image-maker, and whatever involves describing and creating new trends. Mercury pays attention to the detail, even if this can mislead into looking at the tree and not the forest. The ability to store and compare behavioral patterns gives great ability of following sociological, ethnological or even historical sciences. Indeed, such type of minds not only can understand a lot better the whole picture of a stereotype, but can also accurately research beyond its surface. If Mercury is exalted, a scientific career in such a field would be the best professional choice. <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe one thing a native should be very careful of is his tendency towards gossip. Of course, talking about others is a natural means of communication, especially if it is done kind-heartedly, and that is what most of such people feel. Their natural curiosity is making big amounts of information about other people available for them, and it is logical that some of the details are either private or not to be shared with the mass. One should be very careful of not violating the general rule of keeping his nose away from other people’s business, because this can of course come back to him. Search for square and oppositions to Mercury in your chart, to see from which houses they are casted by other planets; those would be the areas of life that you should be more careful with sensitive information. In case that Mercury is very near to the 12th  house cusp, a native has increased possibility of having access to secret information that can become even dangerous if revealed. Do not forget that the 12th house is the house of secret enemies, and especially its cusp is a very potent point of the personal chart. If your Mercury is placed there, handle your information carefully. Not only for the sake of the other person, but mostly for your own safety and well-being.<br />\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n <br />\n<br />\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:06:36'),
(1567, 0, 'us', 'mercury-in-12th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nBeing born with natal Mercury in the 12th house can be a tricky placement, yet it can offer extraordinary abilities connected with the metaphysical. In addition, the person who has Mercury placed here can get involved in healing people who are experiencing problems in speech and expression.\nAs the 12th house is a gate to the other realms, Mercury can grant a native communication with spirits and hidden powers of our world. Even if someone does not believe in the existence of such entities, the native still will be communicating with something that roams outside of our perception. One might call it the collective subconscious, someone else the Akashic fields; no matter what name is used a person with such a placement will observe in his life many situations where his questions are being answered by uncanny cosmic voices and insights. Will this make him a medium? This depends on a lot of other factors, while also the intensity and ability of controlling such phenomena.\nThe 12th house rules the hidden, and thus any such interactions with outer forces will be kept away from other people’s eyes. Such an individual may have fears of not being believed by his close people, and will probably remain silent about a lot of manifestations that occur to him. Mercury is the planet mostly responsible for speech, and placed in the twelfth can gift knowledge of how to use words, chants and writing for magickal purposes.\nIf Mercury is well-aspected, a person with such a placement will be capable of detailed work, while also will excel in negotiations behind the scenes. People may trust him for their secrets, and if the 6th or 10th house cusp is placed in Gemini or Virgo his job may be connected to handling secret information.\nAs a child, the native was probably afraid to speak. Something or someone was intimidating him and the natural reaction was keeping silent in order to retain safety. Mercury in the house of fears can make all kind of worries crawl into the mind of a person, while in extreme situations even create mental illnesses. This placement can bring tendencies for paranoia and the person will be rather afraid of being misunderstood. The 12th house is ruling places of restriction, and an ill-afflicted Mercury can even lead the native need serious medical attention during heavy transits.\nA twelfth house Mercury person will try to deceive all others concerning the way he thinks. This is an internal need developed from his early years, so that no-one can know how his mind is functioning and predict his next movements. In addition, such an individual may have a secret library and do his own researches, without telling barely anyone about his real interests.\nOne of the tricky traits of this natal placement is the tendency to decide upon intuition rather than logic, which can lead to various troubles if Mercury is adversely afflicted. Watch out for squares, oppositions or even conjunctions to Mars and Uranus; such aspects will definitely bring quite a lot of upheaval due to hasty decisions. The twelfth house is ruled by Pisces and Neptune; it is more than profane that such an individual should abstain from alcohol and drug abuse as they can severely blur his thought and lead to mistakes.\nAnother common problematic pattern appearing is dealing with secrets; both of other people and the individual’s own. Mercury will frequently reveal what should not be; the native must learn to think twice before speaking in depth about other’s or his own personal matters. The 12th house can be full of intrigue, so Mercury there can bring quite a lot of gossiping. Again, watch out for adverse connections with Mars and Uranus; they are the ones that can bring unexpected events and catastrophes caused by speaking things that are hidden. \n \n\n\nIf you have Mercury in the 12th House, you are able to read the other people’s movements and voice. There are definitely great abilities of becoming a psychologist, a graphologist or similar professions that combine analysis of characteristics, speech and patterns. In addition, such a person can excel in other occupations such as Speech Therapist or elsehow taking care of individuals that have mental/speech disorders.\nGenerally, with Mercury dwelling in the 12th house of a natal chart, a conscious individual should always have some trusted person or even a professional psychologist to speak with. This can be a great way of creating a mirror for observing himself and the functions of his mind. Such a thing can prevent any unexpected effects of harsh transits to Mercury, as usually the other person will understand possible changes in the native’s behavior and way of thinking. It is always good to have someone keep a track on you and watch your back; we should not forget that the 12th is the house of Neptune and we frequently observe in distorted ways the functions of our personal planets. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written! \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:07:24'),
(1568, 0, 'us', 'mercury-in-10th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving natal Mercury in the 10th house creates the multitasker, and is a brilliant placement for the native’s career. Such people can focus and schedule their movements very thoroughly, while can quite easily transfer their knowledge through speech and writing to others. \n \n\n\nDue to the fact that the 10th house is ruled by Capricorn and Saturn, the Mercurial traits of the native have a rather serious approach. His way of speaking is carefully chosen and there can be exquisite rhetoric abilities. The audiences and readers that receive the native’s words in any type of speech are accepting without obstacles the information he wants to pass. These traits may be developed with the help of the native’s father, who is also a good speaker. The chart owner copies the skills and style of the father, who might even be for the native a mentor figure except from a parent. \n \n\n\nPeople who have Mercury placed in the tenth can excel in careers connected with public expression. Journalism, writing and everything in the area of the media is a job choice that should eventually go very well. Mercury placed here grants harmonic communication with those who are in power, no matter if it is the native’s employers or generally people of authority.\nA tenth house Mercury can be very helpful for people whose occupation is sales. As the 10th house rules being a business owner rather than an employee, a native with such a placement will be successful in owning companies which deal with communications, publishing, news and finances. Accounting is also an area where the person can succeed, as anything that has to do with mathematics, calculations and data processing. \n \n\n\nThe 10th house rules the person’s public image, and Mercury placed here will make him appear rather intellectual towards the masses. This planet does not usually bring fame, unless aspected by other planets responsible for that. Nevertheless, such an individual will be certainly remembered as a smart person, and there might exist a bunch of admirers of his mind. Of course, if he follows some public profession as for example a writer, Mercury can also aid a lot in gaining fame.\nMercury in the 10th house enhances the native’s abilities of multitasking, and gives a lot of possibilities of having two jobs at the same time or being involved in numerous projects simultaneously. He will like having a variety of subjects to concentrate on, and his mind is stimulated by not repeating the same work patterns all over again. Also, as Mercury is a fast-moving planet, there might be quite a lot of work changes during the native’s life. This is received pleasantly by him, as it is perceived as a fresh inflow of energy and kills any possible boredom in the individual’s life.\nMercury has another positive trait which can be rather important for career issues; the native is gifted with great strategic abilities and can wisely choose his career steps. His mind is capable of noticing possible gaps and windows in the market, through which he can establish himself due to lack of competition from others. In addition, his tactical movements may aid him in rising up through a structured system in a corporation or a governmental service. Finally, such a native can use his Mercury in an even smarter- yet not fair- way. He may just speak behind the others’ eyes to people of authority to give him a position, and unless Mercury is ill aspected, he will receive it. After all, flexibility is Mercury’s second nature and a cunning old fox like the native just knows how to move in order to get what he wants!\nIf Mercury has difficult aspects with Mars or Pluto, this placement can make the native be gossiped by others and frequently insulted behind his back. In some situations, the native can receive attacks through written words or speech. His image and ideas will not be appreciated by all the others- and this is natural- but some individuals who maybe even view him antagonistically may find quite a lot of ways to damage his reputation.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:07:28'),
(1569, 0, 'us', 'mercury-in-9th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen a person has his natal Mercury in the 9th house of the chart, the placement makes him be of a rather high intellect, being capable of viewing the big picture. His mind is very broad; on the other hand he can lack the ability to see thoroughly the details.\nThe 9th house is ruling everything that is foreign, and Mercury placed here will definitely make the native learn foreign languages and have a rather different mentality and philosophy than the rest people residing in his homeland. He will be also influenced by foreign cultures and religions, mixing them with the ones he learnt as a child and creating his personal one. His fascination with foreign traditions and people will lead him to a lot of distant travels, especially if the Sun or Venus are also present near his natal Mercury.\nThis placement is the best for writing and publishing, and the individual may be involved in writing about philosophy or religion. Such a person adores researching and is a life long student, mostly of abstract subjects as the ones already mentioned. This helps him develop a higher view on these matters, and his observations can be later transformed into texts of a rather good quality. Curiously enough, one of the reasons that urge him to study is a strong dislike of routine, boredom and shallow meanings; thus his mind is pressing him to open his horizons through learning in order to not fall in depression. People with natal Mercury in the 9th house can be information junkies, love to research encyclopedias and will frequently open 20 tabs of Wikipedia in their browser. The native’s sense of curiosity is very strong and can lead to profound discoveries. \n \n\n\nOf course, this placement has also its negative traits concerning learning; the native does not concentrate on one particular subject and is multitasking while learning. Due to this fact, he will know a lot, probably on nearly every subject that exists, but does not have the time or the will to become deeply specialized in something. Nevertheless, this is usually a conscious choice; becoming specialized in a certain subject will make him bored and he will most probably quit such type of attempts.\nAs the 9th house is ruling higher education, Mercury here can indicate becoming a teacher. The native has quite a lot of possibilities in progressing as an academic professor; on the other hand even religious preachers and gurus can also have this placement. Mercury in the ninth gives a tendency to try to inspire other people, and if afflicted by planets in the 1st or the 12th house may signify an over-inflated ego that needs to mentor people in order to feel pride. An other personal trait to guard from is being a smart-aleck; people who have such a natal Mercury are susceptible to showing off and all types of Luciferian attitudes. Exercising modesty is a great tool of progressing; through such practices the native understands even better his own value. \n \n\n\nThese patterns usually start with a rebellion towards the native’s teachers and parents during childhood. The youngster observes the broadness of his own mind, and discovers that he can learn information that elder people are unaware of. He then uses it as a weapon to counter the knowledge that the elders have, usually without understanding that knowledge dwells in experience and not in the details. With heavy afflictions of Mercury, the young child will frequently hassle his teachers and parents, in an attempt to show that he is smarter than them. These, of course, usually fail; yet such failures become a motivation for further learning as the individual does not like losing and will want to revenge and prove his right. Even this wrong and negative procedure can have a great outcome in his life, as the native gradually self-educates, without understanding how much he invests in his future. \n \n\n\nIf Mercury is adversely afflicted by Mars or Pluto, the native should be careful not to become dogmatic. This placement can make him enforce his own ideas to other people, and even if these ideas are correct and precious he can become highly disliked from others. In case you have such afflictions to your Mercury, understand that your ideas might be correct for yourself but not necessarily apply in the same way for other people. Be a little bit more open towards understanding other points of view and accepting what you feel more correct than your own; you will be later rewarded by upgrading and structuring an even better philosophic model of thought than the previous you had.\nMercury in the 9th house is also a very good position for people who study and exercise the law. It can create lawyers and judges, while also religious people or priests that may have authority positions in certain countries or cultures. Do not forget that even in our days, there are places on Earth where the priest is exercising justice on the people. In case that you have this placement and will be somehow involved in religion, investigate thoroughly the personal reasons hiding behind that choice. If they still contain egoistic traits and the need to have an authority, you are not ready. You will be eventually, but better try later.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:07:34'),

Indeed, the biggest part of their jobs involves thinking, speaking and interconnecting with other people. \n \n\n\nSuch a natal placement is great for working with numbers, computers and also gives great abilities of manipulation through speech. In addition, it can be wonderful for everything connected with books, filing and other types of methodic works. Advertising, writing or public relations are also occupations where the native can excel, while also offering himself real pleasure. \n \n\n\nMercury is a rather neutral planet; thus it does not reveal the nature of the native’s coworkers. They will be also intelligent- as he is himself, but their character and the workplace atmosphere will be mostly shown by any aspects falling on the planet. Nevertheless, the job surroundings will for sure include rapid actions, a lot of brainstorming and restlessness.

The native has great abilities to discover new jobs that are more profitable than the one he already does, and will not hesitate to quit in order to find a new one.\nWhen Mercury is challenged in the 6th it can bring all types of nervous disorders to the chart holder.

His obsession with healthy diets can make him amass quite a lot of information about how the human body functions, making him a very good nutritionist even if he does not follow it as a job. Such people are usually tending to advise everyone around them about diets and food. Even though most of the advice they provide are correct, they can become annoying when try to enforce them upon people who do not care so much about these matters.\nThis natal placement creates a person who values cleanness and hygiene. With hard aspects, Mercury in the 6th can give a hypochondriac, and this is very frequently observed when Mercury is in opposition to some natal planet in the 12th house. As we all know, the 12th house is ruling one’s fears; thus when such a natal aspects exists the native may become paranoid about his health. Curiously enough, the problems that occur to such types of natives are not the ones they fear of; the problem is their own perception of this matter, many times leading to unnecessary stress and anxiety.\nNatal Mercury in the 6th house is an overall good placement, especially in career issues. All the minor problems it can bring are mostly created by the native himself, and are connected to his way of thinking. The best remedy is to always find time to relax and clear his brain from the unnecessary information. Our brain might be an exquisite computer, but even computers need some defragmentation and shutting down once in a while, in order to continue functioning well.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written! \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:07:39');

Their relationship will be based on communication, and the strong bond will continue even when the child becomes an adult. \n \n\n\nThis placement makes the native very gifted concerning communication with children, and is considered excellent for a career as a teacher or in a kindergarten. Playing with them brings joy to the native and he takes great pleasure in entertaining them. The native is able find creative ways for children to learn, while the children tend to adore him as they are having a lot of fun. \n \n\n\nThe native’s mind is constantly drawn towards entertainment. The native has a good sense of humor and has a rather playful character. Mercury in the 5th house will make the native like games and sports that have to do with thinking. He will like chess or any other board game that involves strategy. In addition, he will frequently indulge in playing games of knowledge with friends; in case that the 5th house is connected to his 2nd house or its ruler there are possibilities of winning in a television game of questions. If you have such an aspect, try your knowledge (and luck) at your favorite TV program and maybe you will not regret it!\nAs the 5th house is also ruling gain through speculation, the native’s mind can excel in stock market analysis. He is very intuitive about the future calibrations of the stock values; this makes him able to foresee good bargains to invest in, while also the correct time when to sell.\nA person with Mercury in the 5th house is attracted to talkative people, and will easily open a conversation with a stranger. His flirting is fast and quirky, and there is usually a lot of talking even in bed. The 5th house is responsible of casual sex; so Mercury as a fast-moving planet will bring a lot of short and unstable affairs. Even when in a relationship, a person with such a placement will continue talking and flirting with other people. There is an internal need of playful communication and this does not necessarily imply infidelity. For them, this is mostly sharpening their communicative skills; such people have too much information inside them and adore sharing it. Many times, even the way that the native communicates is childlike; he loves to speak about his favorite music, series or hobbies and can literally go on for hours. When flirting, he will not necessarily indulge in seducing the other person, as it is communication what he yearns for mostly. \n \n\n\nIn case though that Mercury is adversely afflicted, the winged messenger planet has another side, a darker one. The gift of speech can be used for manipulation, and humor can become a Trojan horse for the native’s tactics. There can be multiple love affairs at the same time, with lies and secrecy covering as a fog his erotic life. This is more prominent to happen when Mars, Pluto, Uranus or Neptune are involved with adverse aspects. Usually, such behaviors evolve when Mercury is aspected by more than one malefic.\nA 5th house Mercury person should guard against pride. This placement indeed creates a very smart person- but they are not the only ones. Being a smart-aleck is usually pushing people away, no one likes the smartass who knows everything and doesn’t know to behave well. Forcing the others to receive knowledge is also not the most pleasant experience (for the others, not the one who forces!), so if you have this placement and you see people running away from you, you know what to stop doing.\nWhen someone has Mercury in the 5th house, traditionally ruled by Leo sign, he has excellent abilities of scriptwriting or anything else connected with the theatre and acting.

This placement creates a person who is very interested in researching the traditions; both of his family and of his nation, religion and culture. His childhood years are based on communication, while also usually gives working from home. \n \n\n\nThe fourth house is ruling the less dominant parent (usually the mother), and Mercury makes her have a strong Gemini/Virgo emphasis in her natal chart. This makes her rather talkative and her behavior encourages the child to talk from a very early age. Both she and the father are well-educated and offer to the youngster a very comfortable atmosphere for developing his intellect. They usually have a library at home and the child has direct access to many books and information. There are possibilities that at least one of the parents is a teacher, or elsehow involved in a profession that transfers knowledge and information. The parents dedicate a lot of time in educating him, and make learning something he starts to love.\nThe native’s home becomes a good environment for reading and studying. When he grows up he understands how much he owes to his parents and will probably create the same type of surroundings for his offsprings too. The tradition of discussions during lunch time is something that is passed from generation to another, in such types of families. Also, the parents use a lot of other kinesthetic stimulants for the child’s education, such as puzzles, table games, riddles and other.\nAs the fourth house is ruling one’s residence, the fast motion of Mercury might bring frequent moving to other houses, while at some periods the native might even live in hotels or at friends. There are possibilities of this happening for professional reasons, or even that his job sends him to other towns for special projects that he is involved. Another possibility that this natal placement brings, is working from home (or at least doing a part of the job at the native’s residence). Such people will frequently create an office in their house; the room will be full of books, quiet and perfect for intellectual work.\nThe individual with such a placement will adore digging the roots and the traditions. He might be interested in researching the genealogical tree of his family, the traditions of his country and the writings of religions. There is a strong attraction towards history, archeology, geography and ethnology, while if Mercury is strongly connected to the 9th house the native will late in life get involved with publishing about these subjects. This type of intellectual work is one of the native’s preferred amusements: Sitting in his office, drinking his beverage and dedicating his time to knowledge up to the late hours can be even better than a Friday night out. \n \n\n\nAs the fourth house rules property and real estates, the native may follow professions connected with asset management or real estate finances, while also could be running the financial part of a family business (not necessary his own). This has a lot of possibilities to happen when the 10th house cusp is located in Gemini or Virgo.\nWith Mercury in the 4th house (and the Sun also probably somewhere near), the native is firmly attached to the culture he grew up in, having big difficulties to adapt to other cultures, religions and ways of life. He will prefer to never leave his birthplace or country, and even if he is forced to do so his mind will be constantly focused on his home. Nostalgia and even depression will be the obvious effects; sooner or later he will find the way to go back to where he feels he belongs. When Mercury is adversely afflicted, the native can be really closed to new ideas; this can lead even to traditionalism and fanaticism. Whatever is new can be viewed as a threat to the order he has in his mind, and he does not really support the modern way of life. \n \n\n\nOverall, this Mercury placement is a very good one; the only things one should be careful while having it is becoming overly fanatic about the things he knows (or believes he knows). He should try to be a little bit more flexible about his beliefs and understand that the other people have their own roots too- and most probably they are quite different than his.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '2', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:07:47'),

The third house is traditionally connected to Gemini and their ruler planet Mercury, and thus strongly associated with the intellect.\nThis placement is extremely beneficial to have, and as you can guess it has a very positive effect on the person’s intelligence. Such people are always interested in communications and will spend a lot of time socializing, both through technology and in person. They are rather talkative, which can be attributed to their parents’ encouragement to speak from very early childhood, and to speak a lot. Their parents have been good listeners, and the child developed its speaking and writing abilities lot earlier than the average person. \n \n\n\nMercury in the third house can give siblings that have strong Mercurial emphasis in their natal chart, or a lot of important planets in the signs Gemini and Virgo. If Mercury is adversely aspected, there are possibilities of bipolar disorder or other minor issues. Nevertheless, the mind is always quick and can even reach levels of genius, especially when supported by Uranus. Even when Mercury in the third house has the toughest aspects with malefic planets, the placement remains rather positive. \n \n\n\nAs the third house is ruling short journeys, the native will frequently travel in nearby places and most of the times his trips will be connected with some kind of mental activity. He might have some favorite places where he gets inspired and dedicates himself to writing or thinking. This placement can also create the person that visits the local café in order to write or read books, while also create library addicted people. In general, Mercury placed here makes the native move, having even an effect on his body. The person who has such a placement will never be a couch potato; his quick mind requires the support of an active body, and being lazy is never an option. If there is one thing the third house Mercury can not stand, it is definitely boredom.\nPeople with Mercury present in this house can become great teachers for children. Children will adore the way they communicate while the speaking skills of the native aid him to easily pass the necessary information to the youngsters. This placement is very good for kindergarten workers; nevertheless it usually does not give a career as a professor in higher education unless Mercury is somehow connected with the 9th house and strongly supported by other planets.\nMercury in the third house gives information addicts; people who have this placement adore reading newspapers, blogs, watching the news and even gossiping. Mercury simply loves the intake of information; it needs to be constantly fed with new data as he dislikes boredom and a flow of interesting subjects is keeping him happy. Natives with such a natal position of the winged messenger planet usually keep a diary and organize themselves through writing down lists. If Mercury is aspected by Jupiter, they can become great comedians and possess a quick-witted sense of humor. If Pluto is involved, then their humor style will definitely involve some sarcasm or be macabre. \n \n\n\nThis natal position has nearly no disadvantages, except from sometimes giving feelings of nervousness when the native cannot give his thirsty mind the necessary stimulus that it needs. If you have this placement, enjoy this blessing and take the best that Mercury can offer! Give him what he desires, and he will reward you with a very interesting life, with a daily reality full of small things that will keep you happy and on the move!\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 07:07:51'),

The father is frequently a public figure or elsehow have authority, and the child observes him being respected from other people. This admiration sets similar goals for the native when he grows up; he has the urge to experience the same attitude from the world towards him, and will strive to create himself a successful career. His self-confidence is strongly connected with how other people view him, and he will put his job as a first priority in his life. The native’s aim will not only be to establish a good career; his job is more of a stepping stone towards becoming a paradigm for the community. It is the acceptance from masses that he desires the most. \n \n\n\nA native with the Sun in his 10th house will enjoy public speaking, and generally appearing in front of other people. He has good leadership abilities, and this natal placement can make someone a strong politician or spokesperson. He likes to be the boss, and the Sun is definitely inflating his ego. If the Sun is adversely aspected, the selfishness and egoism that develops will frequently make the person fall from his position, while also can indicate scandals and public disgrace. With good aspects, the good fame is maintained during his life.\nThu Sun in the tenth can also create actors, and if conjuncting the Midheaven will indicate fame. A definite treat that it gives is ambition to climb up the professional ladder, and the native will adjust himself to some image that will help him get accepted. The Sun here will make him invest in clothes and other things that will help his image shine more.\nThe native should be rather careful to not start identifying his own self with the image that he shows towards the others. In such situations, his personal life can get in trouble and his dear people get estranged, because he will be imposing his career image towards them. This image will be quite different from what they are used to see in him, and they might feel he is a totally different person, sometimes judging him for being fake. Indeed, if  the native has planets in the 4th house there might occur oppositions with his natal Sun in the 10th house, creating dilemmas and tensions between his profession and his family, \n \n\n\nWhen a native has this placement, his career might be structured with the help of his father. This natal aspect is typical for people who receive a ready job with already existing clients, and thus will frequently make a native become an advocate, a doctor or anything that can grant a list of clients from his father. In addition it can bring clients from other strong authority figures; the native will have friends who are in power positions and will constantly recommend him to their surroundings.\nGenerally, when a person has his Sun in the 10th house, he will not like working for some other employer. He wants to hold his fate in his hands, and very seldom would someone with such an aspect agree to do a job as a simple employee. Nevertheless, such people are usually offsprings of rich families and there will be no strong need to work in order to survive. The person with this Sun placement will take his time to study and become strong enough before entering the job world.\nThis is overall a wonderful placement of the Sun, and our bright star illuminates the house of Saturn and Capricorn, shading light in their cold surroundings. The people who have it should be considered lucky, both because they will usually experience a rather wealthy life and because their goal will not be surviving but prospering. The only thing to guard of if you have this placement is your own self and your pride. Pride is not a bad thing and can motivate us a lot, but making our ego the very center of our existence will eventually bring the Hybris and the Nemesis, and we will learn our lesson.

On the other hand, as the 12th house is ruled by Neptune and the sign of Pisces, the Sun is in a weak placement. This is even more prominent when it is in Cancer, Pisces or Libra; on the contrary if in a fire sign it will preserve most of its powerful traits. \n \n\n\nThe 12th house is an open gate to the collective subconscious and unconscious. Thus, any planet located inside will give at least some psychic ability, even if it is uncontrolled and not frequent in manifestation. When the Sun is placed here, the case is exactly the opposite. The person will have a strong connection to the deeper realms of consciousness, and this will be frequently strengthened when they pass time alone. Indeed, the Sun in the 12th house is an indicator of seclusion. Usually, it will make someone a loner and the restriction will be imposed by himself and not by others. \n \n\n\nSuch people can be rather shy, preferring to not be the center of attentions. The Sun in the 12th house can make them secret benefactors; they will frequently help others without trying to take any type of credit for their benevolent actions. Generally, they like being behind the scenes, and if the Sun is ill-aspected it can even project as agoraphobia. They will generally dislike being in large crowds, preferring introspection. If the Sun is placed in a water sign, the native will enjoy passing his lonely time near the sea or a lake, frequently gazing towards the waters as if he is hypnotized. A common pattern appearing for natives with this natal placement is being bullied during their childhood. This is definite to happen if the Sun is aspecting the asteroid Chiron, and can leave a trauma in the child’s soul.\nThe Sun placed here indicates an interest in psychology and the occult. The native will be playing the role of psychologists towards others even if he is not qualified as one. He will not be receiving something in return, and his advices can be as good as a professional’s. On the other hand, he will rarely implement the same advice on himself, frequently due to the fact that he does not have a concrete perception of his own self. Such types of people will feel themselves more as souls than bodies, and this is the precise reason of forgetting to give to their body the necessary exercise and care. When one has natal Sun in the 12th house he should be careful of what people he socializes with, because they can absorb energies as a sponge. Negative people in their immediate surroundings will be a daily dose of poison. This can be also a reason for their loneliness, which indeed is many times beneficial in order to cleanse from the effects that other people impose with their presence.\nMany natives who have their Sun in the twelfth house have a rather weak father, who is either absent or passive as a character. If the native’s Sun has hard aspects, then the father might be a substance or alcohol addict. With a positively aspected Sun, the native’s father is a very good person, but with a totally passive and unsuccessful role in life. He might be very compassionate towards everyone, but totally unable to structure his own life and be a strong parent figure for the native. In extreme cases, this natal placement of the Sun can make the native not know his father. This happens when Sun is adversely linked with Pluto or with Neptune. Pluto can indicate early death of the father while Neptune will build a fog around him; this can create orphans or elsehow make the father unknown to the native.\nIf the Sun is somehow connected with the career houses, the 6th and the 10th, the native may work in a prison, a hospital or an asylum; generally in all places that restrict other people. In case that the Sun is somehow linked to the 9th house, responsible for religion, the individual might be drawn towards monasteries or other religious places. In some extreme cases, when the Sun is heavily challenged by malefics, difficult transits can even make the native be secluded in such an institution. Of course, this is not the general rule, or else we would have roughly 10 percent of the population being held in places of restrictions. \n \n\n\nIf you have this natal placement, do not forget that you also have a body. Developing the mind is wonderful, but it needs a strong body to function well and for long. In addition, you should think more about yourself than about other people. You must learn how to love yourself more, in order to love the others in the right way. Selflessly helping everyone is an amazing act of altruism. But just imagine how much more helpful you would be to your beloved ones (and to the unknowns you tend to help) if you are in a stronger position.

He will not be the typical tourist; the Sun here indicates a person who will try to spend as much time possible in order to get deeper in the foreign country’s traditions. Such a native will probably learn a foreign language, and this is certain to happen if Mercury is also located inside the 9th house. One of the two parents of the native can be of a different culture, race or religion, so this placement may gift him with learning both parent languages at the same time. In some occasions, the Sun in the ninth will make the native be born in a different country than the one he is raised in.\nIn addition, the Sun may even grant him with a life in a distant country, even if this is for some years and not his entire life. In some situations, when slow moving planets form an important transit aspect with his natal Sun, this relocation might even be permanent. The Sun in the ninth house could even give to a native the acceptance of a new religion, or at least the development of a different type of personal spirituality from the one he initially had. The native will like reading about myths and legends, while also about religions, probably researching the writings of a lot of them.\nThe 9th house is ruling higher education, and the Sun’s placement is frequently indicating academic studies. These could even be a reason for a temporary relocation to a foreign environment; nevertheless if it is ill-aspected by malefics then the studies will last longer than expected. Especially aspects by Saturn will cause delays; on the other hand the normal function of the Sun is to bring positive outcomes in his learning processes.\nEducation is strongly connected to the native’s self-esteem; this makes them a priority and a driving force for his personal success. If Leo is connected to his 6th or 10th house, the native may even have a career as an academic; an alternate outcome is working in a country far from his homeland. \n \n\n\nThe Sun in the 9th house can give a strong interest in spirituality, religion or the law. These interests can influence the native to become a person of authority, or have some position in such types of systems. They are usually inspired by justice, and can even become sports referees in case that Mars has a strong influence on the Sun. Alternate life-paths that such a person can follow are being a diplomat, a translator or even a writer, mostly concentrating on philosophical subjects.\nIn any case, this Sun’s natal placement will make the native develop his own philosophic system in his mind, and being able to perceive the big picture better than the rest. Knowledge and its expansion are an important part of his life, he will continue exploring and widening his horizons until the end of his life. On the other hand, the 9th house is not about the details, so this individual might not specialize in a concrete subject but rather spread himself to numerous ones. \n \n\n\nSuch a natal placement can create a very developed personality, but also make the native less practical in his reality. The philosopher will not care a lot about the daily routines and will frequently pass his time inside his higher ideas. The thinker will act less than the average people, and could even give a weak body; if you have this placement you should invest more time in exercising and a little bit less to the world of ideas. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 10:22:35'),

The native shines through groups, and is feeling as a hyper-organism rather than an individual, as his perception of Ego also involves the larger units in which he belongs. His “Me”, is more of a “We”.\nThe person with such a placement tends to make powerful friends and indulge in a lot of group activities. He will probably belong to fraternities, political parties or other types of organization. He takes pride from his social life and adores teamwork, while also can have strong leadership abilities. His friendships, particularly with male friends, might last very long; this natal aspect also gives the tendency to become friends with people that have similar character to the native’s father. This pattern can also bring a lot of friend with heavy Leo emphasis, being public figures or in having some authority position in the society.\nSuch an individual will prefer passing his time with his friends than alone, while this placement can also bring misunderstandings with his love affairs, as he may frequently choose his friends over his girlfriends. This is definite to happen if the natal Sun in the 11th house is in opposition with some malefic planet in the 5th. As the 11th house is traditionally ruled by Aquarius and Uranus, the native will be of a tolerant nature and believe in equality between friends. Such kinds of people promote brotherhood in a group and help it function harmonically. They are not judgmental, and will frequently befriend unconventional individuals.\nThe Sun in the 11th house can bring a lot of help through friends. In case that the 2nd or 8th house cusp falls in Leo, that help could be even financial. If their Sun or Leo is connected with the 6th or the 10th house, their powerful friends will help them find jobs or elsehow establish a career. This natal placement will frequently make someone hold an office or a special position in an organization. The native may be accepted by most of the members as a good choice for the group’s stability, and bring consensus even between parts of it that confront each other. Indeed, such a native can bring harmony to the group, making as a center of it the targets and values that all the members can relate to.\nOf course, if the Sun is adversely aspected a variety of problems can occur. The native can totally detach from his private life, dedicating too much of his personal time to the groups he belongs without having particular benefits in return. Also, hard aspects from malefic planets like Mars or Pluto might mean betrayals from friends or group members, while also immoral means of rising in the hierarchy of the organization. \n \n\n\nAn 11th house Sun makes the person a humanist, having romantic or even delusive visions of a better society. This placement may lead him to fight for such causes, and in case that the Sun is well aspected he will even achieve some of his goals. With hard aspects, he is susceptible to lose the initial romanticism somewhere in the road; his personal egoism might devour his altruistic tendencies and make the groups he belongs in a source of power, fulfilling his needs of self-confidence. Indeed, following the romantic vision is not easy, especially when one will be tempted by benefits that a powerful position in a group can offer. On the other hand, it is definitely better to try it instead of not. \n \n\n\nIn a woman’s chart, this placement will bring a lot of male friends; her father is probably a strong person with an important position in the society and her copying of his character can give her a male way of thinking. She is easily accepted by other men as equal, and might even reach leading a group which consists mostly by men. In any case, such a Sun placement will make a powerful woman with a variety of goals and objectives, ready to offer to the social system and frequently becoming a spokesperson or general secretary. Her organizational abilities can be broader than any man’s, and she will be widely respected for keeping the group in a good order. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 10:22:39'),

It is a very strong indicator of marriage, even when the Sun has adverse aspects by malefics. The native feels complete only when united with a significant other, and feel great pride through their spouse. Their self-esteem is directly connected to their partner, and will choose one that has a radiant and energetic character. Most probably, the native will be the less powerful in the relationship; nevertheless this does not seem a problem for them. What they are searching for is indeed someone more powerful than them, in order to feel supported. Their marriage partner will be of a dominant but kind nature, frequently having the natal Sun in the first house; there are also possibilities of him being a Leo Ascendant or Sun sign, or otherwise have strong Sun/Leo emphasis in his chart.\nSo strong is the need of blending with others, that 7th house Sun people will sacrifice a lot of themselves in order to be with someone else. They adore pleasing the other and will easily change themselves in order to fit in the requirements that their partner has. Loneliness is killing them, and therefore if a marriage or a relationship ends they will not stay too long without another. If their natal Sun is not heavily challenged, this placement indicates a happy marriage and a beautiful marital life. Also, it gives a tendency of overspending for the wedding ceremony. Usually, the native will marry a partner of a higher social class, and gain prestige through this union.\nThe 7th house is ruling one’s open enemies, and with the Sun placed here the native will have good diplomatic skills. There are quite a lot possibilities of even turning one’s open enemies to friends, and such people are very good negotiators in business matters. In addition, this placement can give a strong knowledge of manipulation; the native knows how to use other people but in such a way that it becomes a win-win situation for both. People do not usually notice this ability, and will actually not have a problem with it as it usually also serves their own interests.\nWhen an individual has his natal Sun in the 7th house, there is definite luck in business partnerships. Indeed, the person will be a lot more successful when entering business together with someone else, and there is general harmony in between them. Sun in the 7th favors all types of contracts, and will aid the native in legal affairs. This placement will turn luck in favor of the chart owner in case of legal disputes. In addition, the native will be very proud of his business partnerships, which might even lead to showing off. The same thing will probably happen with his spouse; he will have enormous pride in showing to the world the person he is married to. \n \n\n\nIn a woman’s natal chart, this placement will bring a husband who has similar traits to her father. She needs a father figure in her life and her subconscious will choose someone with common traits. In a man’s chart this can indicate a need to climb the social ladder and a lack of self-confidence; the native prefers a more powerful woman than him and will gladly jump through her to a higher social class. Of course, he will willingly sacrifice his own power to achieve this, as his wife will be a very strong character who wants to be the leading person of their union. \n \n\n\nIn case that the Sun is badly aspected, then the native’s marriage partner may have a very inflated egoism and be very domineering. The same will happen to possible business partners. Nevertheless, these unions will still function well, but with a lot of effort from the native and –usually- by his overlooking of any difficult characteristics that the partner has.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 10:22:44'),

In addition, as the 6th house rules the body’s condition, the presence of our bright Star will make health matters an important part of a native’s life.\nHaving the natal Sun in the 6th house might be a tricky placement, especially concerning one’s health. Even though the Sun illuminates the house’s matters, giving a rather good vitality and an abundance of energy, difficult aspects to the Sun might complicate one’s health. The Sun is rather vulnerable when in the sixth house; when well aspected it can act as a great shield, on the contrary adverse aspects can create an Achilles foot to the native. When in the 6th the Sun is directly tied to one’s health, and adverse aspects from all malefics find an open gate to manifest. Such a natal Sun will often create a doctor, a medic or a healer; nevertheless the Sun can make their profession a personal matter of pride and egoism, rather than a selfless service towards the society. \n \n\n\nCuriously enough, the 6th house is connected with one’s clothes; the Sun will frequently bring over-spending concerning clothes and a very chic style of dressing. The native will be proud of what he wears, even reaching fetishism towards the desired style objects. The clothes will not represent his economic class but rather a class higher than him, and can lead to false pride.\nThe Sun in the 6th house makes the native a workaholic, usually excellent in his job. His dedication to what he does, might have a bad effect on his health as he will tend to overdue with working. On the other hand, it is very difficult to convince such a person to relax and lower the pace of working, as his occupation is linked to the feeling of personal pride, making his self-esteem a priority. The worst nightmare of such a native is to not be able to work for some reason; he will feel having lost the ground under his feet. He will strive to recuperate the quickest that he can, just to return to his work and feel safety in his favorite surroundings again. There is no bigger satisfaction to such a native, as getting praised for what he accomplishes at work. \n \n\n\nThe Sun in the 6th house makes the native identify his existence through what he does for a living. He will strive to find a work that he likes, and career doors will usually open easily for him. Such an individual does not like criticism, and anything else that can hurt his ego- or even worse his feelings about his work. When he is under-appreciated, he will frequently suffer and the bad flow of energy can even directly affect his health, while also kill his motivation to continue working.\nA wonderful remedy for a 6th house natives are pets. Usually, a person with such a natal placement will have a pet, with which the relationship will be even more important than with his family or other people. This small animal is a personal healer for the native, and can be of a big help- especially in periods that his work or health are challenged. Individuals having their Sun placed here are advised to connect with small animals as much as they can, and if they do not have a pet to obtain one. Indeed, this natal placement of the Sun can even create veterinaries or other types of professions that have to do with caring about animals. \n \n\n\nOne thing the native should be careful of, is his strong urge to be a perfectionist. As the 6th house is traditionally ruled by Mercury, the Sun’s presence will make him invest large amounts of energy into details. This might make him excel in some of the things he does, but the overall task of pure perfection is rather unattainable. The wisest advice such a native can follow, is to learn distinguishing the golden point of when to stop. Creating a perfect product or offering a state-of-the-arts service can be great, but there is a point where investing more time and dedication will not any longer have a radical effect on the quality. Learn to understand when to chill down and relax; no-one will blame you for such details that only you can see.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 10:22:52'),
(1580, 0, 'us', 'sun-in-5th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nThe Sun feels at home in the 5th house, because the house is traditionally ruled by Leo. This is a very good natal placement, enhancing the native’s recreational life, love affairs and gives a very playful character. It is a very good natal aspect for having children and raising them. Nevertheless, some minor problems can occur with the individual’s ego; it can become very inflated to a dramatic point.\nAlready from his childhood age, the native develops great athletic abilities and is very interested in all types of fun and recreation. He is competitive and pleasure loving, a rather popular child in his school and developing Alpha male tendencies. In case the chart owner is a woman, she likes to play with the other boys and many times wins, making them even feel disgrace to have lost from a girl. The placement creates a child that adores being the center of attention and develops a very strong perception of ego. This is not necessarily bad, as the love of one’s self is vital in order to progress in life. On the other hand, when one loves only himself, this can create problems. Narcissism and egocentrism mostly occur when the natal Sun has adverse aspects with Mars, Jupiter and Venus.\nWhen the Sun is in the 5th house of a natal chart, it will make the native a good performer. He will probably have a bunch of abilities together; dancing, acting, singing – whatever can get him noticed. Careers in arts are favored, especially when the Sun is aspecting Venus or Neptune. Moreover, such type of an individual is very good in recreational activities with children- they adore having fun with him. As a result, this natal placement can be prominent in teachers or other professions connected with kids, especially if the Sun sextiles planets in the 3rd house that promote teaching as a profession. \n \n\n\nHaving the Sun in the 5th house will give a male first child. Nevertheless, to have children it is better that the Sun is not in a fire Sign, as when it is located in Aries, Leo or Sagittarius the native could have low fertility. So much fire is not the best for fecundation; the presence of a water or air sign, or a benefic planet aspecting the Sun can greatly increase the possibilities of having a child. In any case, children will play an important role in the native’s life, and he will get involved with his siblings’ or friends’ children even if he does not have ones of his own.\nDid we mention that the 5th house is also responsible for partying? Well, as you can imagine, a person with his Sun located in the house will be a party animal. Parties illuminate his life, and he will be constantly seeking the best places to go out. A big part of his income will be spent on all type of recreational activities, and in case of hard aspects with Mars or Neptune he will drink a lot or even experience substance abuse. This placement is not the best to have for gambling. Indeed, maybe this hobby is a lot of fun for such an individual, but the Sun is showing mostly losses; the house is illuminated through the activity but does not produce an income. There are possibilities of gaining from gambling or speculation, but only if the Sun is trining Jupiter or Venus in the second house, and generally is well aspected. On the other hand, conjunctions, squares and oppositions of the Sun to Mars, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Pluto are a definite no-no for such types of activities. Play a poker game with your friends, but do not even enter a casino because it could start becoming your home. \n \n\n\nAs we are speaking about the 5th house, we would not forget to mention the native’s love life. As you already suspect, the Sun in the fifth house gives a very vivid sexuality, a lot of partners and a constant feeling of falling in love. It is not the most stable placement for long relationships; a fifth house Sun will frequently change partners and flirt, preferring to be unfaithful. Usually, this natal placement gives medium-length but intense relationships, until of course he finds the right one to create children with. When the native becomes a parent, there is a tendency for dedicating more time to the children than to the spouse, and even behaving as a child. Frequently, the spouse will be the serious parent, while the native will be the one spoiling the kids and doing monkey-business together.\nIf you have this placement, you know yourself how fun it is! The only advice that we can give is to be careful with your (probably) inflated egoism. Our ego is indeed a very important drive for our evolution, but sometimes exercising humility is always helpful in order to understand the real meaning of your ego. Yes, you are a God and the center of the universe. But there is a second part to that sentence, which has to be learned too, so that the equation functions correctly. You are also Nothing, and you are just another center of the universe. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 10:22:55'),

The native’s biggest dream is to create a big family, own a big house and become the respected leader among them, connecting all of his kin under his presence. Such an aspect creates a person who loves traditions and will somehow invest efforts in preserving them. \n \n\n\nAs the fourth house is responsible the roots, the home and the family where the individual is born, having the brightest object of the sky in this house illuminates all affairs that it rules. This aspect tends to bring prosperity in the latter parts of one’s life, as he chooses to progress slowly but steadily. A native with the Sun located there will plan long-term, and this will definitely bring him success through small steps. He will not spend a lot of money in having fun but rather keep what he earns for his family and for the future days.\nHaving the Sun in the house of your roots may signify being a descendant of an aristocratic or well-known family. This aspect gives pride of your roots, and plays an important role in your self-esteem. There can be some legacy coming from his ancestors; even some objects that are passing through the generations- of which he will also be very proud and display them in his home for the public.\nThe fourth house rules the less dominant parent, or the parent who stays at home. Usually, the astrologers claim that it always rules the mother. The presence of Sun in this house makes either the mother very dominant or the father frequently present at home during the native’s childhood. If the Sun is in a harsh aspect with Pluto, the father might have died during the native’s early years or elsehow abandoned the family. This aspect makes the mother receive the role of the father in raising the native. Generally, the childhood years are remembered as a bright period; this will furthermore make him strive towards creating a family of his own and offering a balanced surrounding for his children to grow.\nThe Sun in the 4th house makes the native be very interested in the tradition of his family, of his birthplace or of his nation. He will invest a lot of time and effort in learning them and trying to preserve them. This could be anything from traditional handcrafts, dances, music or arts. Such people are not only saving traditions but also reviving them. In many occasions they can gain a lot of wealth connected to what they try to save from oblivion; this will mostly happen when their 2nd house cusp lies in Leo, if their natal Sun is sextiling a benefic planet in the 2nd house or if it forms some positive natal aspect to the ruling planet of the 2nd house.\nWhen the Sun is located in the 4th house it creates an interest in the real estate, in agriculture and anything connected with land. The native will have a lot of success if he chooses such careers, especially when his natal Sun is positively aspecting planets connected with the 10th house. There are high possibilities that he will receive land and houses from his ancestors, and becomes rich through selling them. Another possibility is that the native receives a ready business that his ancestors are running for a long time. This could be a traditional restaurant, a small factory which produces a small trademark product or drink, or anything else that includes the soul of the family during long years. \n \n\n\nFor such kind of individuals, a solid foundation to live is an important priority. They need to feel kings of their castles and create a nest for their offsprings, to be both able to protect them but also to rule over them. If you have your Sun adversely aspected by malefics, be careful of being over-dominant towards your family. You might be thinking that you offer them stability, but cutting the wings of your youngsters will create them traumas- probably the same type that your parents created in you.

The presence of the Moon makes the individual sensitive concerning financial matters, and usually makes his income fluctuating frequently, just like the tide of the sea.\nThis pattern’s origin might be from the mother, who has also been rather insecure concerning money during the native’s childhood. The mother was emotionally attached both to the child and to her house, and the native will frequently spend his money on items used for cooking. Other expenses include decorations for his home and furniture. In case that Venus is also present in the house, or aspecting the Moon, there will be over-expenses on luxurious objects. In general, such kinds of people dedicate a big part of their income to their family and immediate surroundings. A second house Moon person will not indulge in investing his money into social activities, unless these are happening in his own house.\nPossible sources of income are areas connected with the Moon, Cancer and the fourth house, traditionally ruled by the planet and its sign. These could be food, working from home or even being engaged with real estate. A lot of people who own restaurants or work as cooks have this placement, especially if the Moon is somehow connected with the 6th and/or 10th house. The Moon does not help for establishing a healthy income/expense pattern. Big part of the money can be spent in a rather short period, forcing the native to withstand difficult days till his next payment. Curiously enough, he will do the same thing again and again. \n \n\n\nAn issue that the Moon in the second house can create is becoming overly attached to people. Such natives can hold onto others very tightly, developing feelings of belonging and owning towards them. The same can appear towards objects, especially if the object is carrying some memory and nostalgia. They can have a difficult time parting with things they like, and in extreme situations when the Moon is heavily afflicted they can literally fill closets with useless stuff. The individual can have many tendencies to become a collector, and difficult Lunar aspects with Mercury or/and Pluto can create a very obsessive personality, dedicating his time into worshipping this fetish objects. \n \n\n\nThere are high possibilities for the native to be financially dependant on his mother, even in his adult years. If it is not the mother who helps, then it should be some other mother figure, which does not necessarily have to be older. This could even be the native’s girlfriend or wife, while in a female horoscope a female friend, aunt or grandmother. Anyone who plays the nurturing role of the mother in the native’s life can become his Moon shining in the house of material possessions. If the individual with such a placement is a man, he is advised to work on his masculine side as over-activating the Lunar energy will make him a very passive character, unable to hold his life in his own hands. \n \n\n\nWhen the transiting full Moon falls in this house, there might be unexpected windfalls of money. Nevertheless, this happens roughly once a year in the native’s horoscope, and to receive big amounts the transiting full Moon must be supported by other transits too. In all the rest cases, the earnings of the day/period will just appear to be higher than usual, and will be quickly spent.\nFinally,  small piece of magic advice, taken from the Russian traditions for people whose wealth is connected with the Moon: Take a silver coin, and hold it in front of the young crescent in the sky, the days after a New Moon. The energy of the waxing moon will expand the silver in your hands, and your money will be multiplied. The same can be done with anything silver: spoons, jewels and more. Be careful to not do the opposite, showing your silvery to a waning Moon: the effect will be to empty your pockets from money.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:44:31'),
(1583, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-1st-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen the Moon is located in the first house of a natal chart, the native becomes a sensitive and intuitive person. Feelings are very important for him, and he can be rather hasty in his reactions, deciding his movements without depending on logic and common sense but rather on his intuition. \n \n\n\nThey are rather passive, except if some strong male planet is present in the first house. Their behavior is quite moody and changeable – this is due to the fast movement of the Earth’s satellite. Their feelings are fluctuating the same way the sea tide does; there is a monthly pattern that more or less reappears. Even in Male horoscopes, it gives to the person bio-cycles connected with the Lunar calendar and not the Solar. The man with Moon in the first house will have some feminine behaviors, but the Moon does not affect so much his sexual preferences; these are mostly indicated by Mars, Venus and their aspects. \n \n\n\nAs an appearance, the Moon’s presence gives to the native pale skin, which if the Ascendant falls in a Water sign can be nearly totally white. The hair tends to be black or at least dark, and also is more possible if a the moon resides in a watery sign. Their cheeks are quite rounded, while their weight can fluctuate a lot of times during their life. Their overall appearance changes through time; they are frequently following the changes in fashion and will even maybe annoy their friends by stealing their new appearance style immediately when they see it. If the Moon is somehow connected with Venus, then fashion might be the most important thing in their life.\nThey have a very deep relationship with their mother, and copy a lot of her characteristics and attitudes. In their love life, they adore cuddling and exchanging feelings of safety with their partner. In addition, they are rather romantic; they will frequently express their affection through offering presents, organizing surprises or otherwise externalizing their positive feelings. Even when their love-life is going well, they spend some days a month in melancholy without an apparent reason. Usually this is connected with thoughts about possible negative events in the future of the relationship, and such actions should be avoided as they can co-create the reality that is to come. \n \n\n\nTheir Lunar character makes them easy to manipulate, especially in their young ages. They are prone to melancholy, like the darkness of the night and feed on moonlight; if their natal Moon is heavily afflicted they are likely to develop Lunacy, melancholy, hysteria or other mental disorders that will be following the phases of the Moon even if the native never observes that. Moon in 1st house people can be very psychic, catch future events through dreams and “read” the feelings and thoughts of other people just by being near them. They are very nurturing, and love to make their dear people feel comfortable; the same applies to themselves – they adore feeling tenderness and being cared of. Their emotions are difficult to hide, and other people can easily understand the mood of such individuals.\nThe Moon is the planet which is most responsible for cooking, and people with this placement are usually great both in cooking and in enjoying food. If their 6th or the 10th house cusp falls on Cancer, or the Moon is elsehow connected to a planet in the 6th or the 10th, the person might even choose cooking as a profession.\nThe Moon creates people that are very dependant to others. They do not yearn to become leaders; they prefer to follow someone even if they are not somehow lower than him. They like to reflect more than radiate, and this functions great for them if the Moon is not very afflicted. In the opposite scenario, they can easily follow wrong paradigms, follow dishonest people and copy some of their characteristics.

(1584, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-7th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving the moon in the 7th house has a drastic effect on partnerships and everything that has to do with unification. Should it be marriage, a stable business relationship, or other type of contract, the moon’s light gives a special hue to this life subjects’ department. \n \n\n\nThe feminine energy of the moon makes an individual drawn to relations and blending with another soul, making them prefer to avoid any type of solitary activity. The need for emotional support and fulfilment is strongly present.\nThe moon is the quickest-moving celestial body. As such, this can bring hastiness and instability in the house it is located. This results in jumping from one relationship to another, many times having delusions that the significant other is the one and only.\nThis in particular is stronger in people who were born at a full moon, because then the moon acts as a shining pendulum of hypnosis, reflecting in full the light of the sun. Such kind of people should be careful, for what they are really seeing is the reflection of the sun which is located in the 1st house. They actually seek being themselves and strengthening their sun aspects which even is responsible for the body and vitality, but they look towards the opposite direction, magnetized by the beauty of the full moon. The opposition of these two celestial bodies gives great possibilities of a problematic family and early years of the native, with the parents either separating or quarrelling.\nFear of being alone, makes the 7th house moon people jumping to new relationships rather quickly, and building dependency faster than other individuals. In a man’s horoscope, the moon placed there gives big importance to the women of his life. He wants closeness and security in his relationships. It is very common that such a person is attracted to people with prominent moon or a having a lot of characteristics of Cancer. There is high possibility of the mate to have physical looks that are of Moon and Cancer. It can draw a Cancer ascendant person, or a Moon in the 1st house person, which both tend to give white skin, dark or even raven-black hair, general paleness and slimness. It could also bring Goth-style significant others, especially if Uranus or Pluto are involved with some aspect to the Moon.\nAnother general rule is that it attracts sensitive partners, and the feeling of mothering or being mothered is typical in the couple. The exchange of energy comes highly through sleeping hugged together, caressing and nurturing each other. If the 7th house moon lays in Taurus, the couple might express their affection in feeding each other and indulging in gourmet experiences together. There is high osmosis between the partners, and feelings are flowing strongly, thus also being vulnerable to outside interventions. The couple’s sleeping together can bring mixing of dreams, or even prophetic abilities through dreaming.  Of course, the moon also influences moody behaviors, and when heavily afflicted by Uranus or other malefics can have as a result the tendency to relate with hysteric or depressive characters.\nMore than one marriage or long relationship is highly likely, and the Moon’s shining can trigger a public type of official vocation. The native can receive positions that are connected with a public image, and make him generally known. Of course, the Moon can never guarantee a prolonged publicity by itself – it is rather drown towards the opposite, unless there are slow moving planets strengthening the moon’s position by triangles or sextiles.\nIn a man’s horoscope, when the Moon is only positively afflicted, it gives a very good wife. The pattern should involve also a very good mother, which is afterwards emotionally replaced by the spouse. It indicates good business partnerships, especially in what has to do with design and art. On the other hand, when there are a lot of hard aspects, both the emotional life and work life have quick ups and downs. \n \n\n\nThey have a strong ability of absorbing other people’s mood, and if in hard aspects with Neptune they can be very easily hypnotized or emotionally used. Their psychic ability is strong, depending also to what other planets exist in water signs and on aspects from the outer planets (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto). These affecting the moon can open gates to the realms of collective subconscious and mass psychology, which also empowers artists and designers can gain their reputation. They can feel generational waves of styles and patterns arriving to the material world, and create such products before the beginning of the wave. Thus, they can even become influential leaders in new waves of art.\nMany are also good cooks, or involved in cooking business. It is not unusual for a 7th Moon Pluto to be meaning being a co-owner of a restaurant, with great care being dedicated from the native to its functioning. In case there is a conjunction of Moon an Venus, the native will be dedicating a lot of effort also in the appearance of the food, making it perfect for high-class gastronomical business.\nWhen the Moon is conjunct Mars, one should be aware that his spouse might tend to participate in violent and rude behavior, which will be in the native’s hands to soften. Saturn in conjunction can bring problems and delay of marriage, which could be afterglows of a cold and distant approach pattern of the native’s mother. Jupiter, in contrary, brings a wealthy and happy partner, enhancing and strengthening the Moons fragile and moody light.\nA 7th Moon person can heal himself and others through nurturing, and taking care of people can even balance negative natal aspects. In case he manages to stabilize his union’s moody characteristics, moonlight can guarantee him a pleasant unification, full of sweetness, mutual acceptance and romantic love. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:44:45'),
(1585, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-3rd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving the Moon in the house of communication creates a very receptive mind, capable of filling large capacities inside it with information. Thus, such a native can amass a huge load of data among many subjects, picking up new languages, even providing a talent for imitating other people’s voices and images. The moon helps a lot in reflecting and re-projecting external patterns, and when in aspect to planets responsible for art can produce great artists. The same applies if stelliums of planets are found near the moon, and depending on the nature of them the native usually follows working with his hands. This could be from a sculptor to a car mechanic, but definitely gives ability and even accuracy to anything created by hands. \n \n\n\nThe moon in the third usually brings along it sensitivities in whatever is connected with comunication. The native inserts a lot of emotion to them, and the hastiness of the moon can bring frequent changes in opinions, ideas and even people towards whom the communication flows. As this house is also responsible for short trips, one will indulge in frequent weekend journeys in nearby places. This placement can make someone take care of a country-house nearby his house, having his off days passed there and usually taking also care of a garden. If the moon is very close to the end of the house, the country-house might come from his mother or her lineage. If the moon is in Taurus or other fertile sign then it is frequent that agriculture and garden activities are not only present as a hobby but even a way of life. \n \n\n\nIn case that someone follows an artistic path, the moon gives a lot of emotion on his works too. The artist will tend to be romantic, giving to his art mellow characteristics. The atmosphere present is usually dreamy, and all types of emotions are usually inspirative for the native. An external observer will be able to recognize in the artists creations what type of emotions they try to describe, and their works can be really influential to the audience as they can bring out archetypes of the collective subconscious. They have exceptional psychological insight, managing to depict other’s people feelings also on their creations. \n \n\n\nThe third house is also traditionally governing siblings. Such a person can have a brother or sister that is Cancer or has otherwise a strong Moon in his natal chart (near the Ascendant, inside the First house or in other important position of his chart). Usually the siblings are very emotional, passing this sensitivity also to the chart’s owner. Also, another characteristic it gives is natural curiosity, which can lead to investing a lot of time in reading books, studying or expanding their horizons to different subjects and crafts. Nevertheless, from this is excluded higher education, as it is represented by the ninth house which lays completely opposite this one. If both houses have planets, their energies are polarized, which leads quite often for differences between the middle level studies and the higher ones. This can even be quite good, as the native can create a unique combination of different types of knowledge, sometimes leading in their mixture in a totally new and quite personal blend. The opposition of the third house moon with important planets in the ninth house always brings internal contradictions; there can be even dilemmas of choosing a place to live, abroad or in his birthplace.\nThe neighbors are also ruled by the third house, so a moon there brings frequent visits from them. The “popping in for coffee” pattern can be widely observed, and the placement also promotes the organization of barbecue type events. Neighbors can be even seen as a part of the family and the native’s house is becoming a lair for other people to pass time. Moon, as the planet mostly responsible for cooking, will enhance these meetings with the offering of food and drink, creating a shiny atmosphere.\nOne thing such a native should concentrate on, is to taming his mood while communicating. The Moon is giving some instability due to its quick movement, and feelings can easily over-flood the words said, as long as the reception of other’s words. Such a native should consciously examine his expressions, to understand how the Moon and its phases can react on it, and by being a little bit more careful those concrete days he can stabilize this flow that is not easily controlled as it touches parts of the psyche. Also, daydreaming might be wonderful but touching the ground once in a wile should become for them a priority. Indeed, it can only enhance the ability to daydream, as the native will not risk getting lost in his (usually romantic) fantasies.\nAnother pattern that can appear is that the native acts like a maternal figure to a smaller sibling, or being the small one that is raised up like this. The bond is strongly connecting the two, lasting long years and granting a lot of care, especially when combined with other good aspects. Also, as the third house is governing transportation, the native is usually having a vehicle, to which he also gets emotionally attached. Nevertheless, it is frequent to change even them as Moon is definitely the planet that governs stability. Such natives are also preferring to have the TV or radio on, as they enjoy the frequent flow of information even as a background of their life. They feel quite comfortable when are surrounded by observable flows. In case the third house Moon is placed in a water sign, there is no better self-healing than relaxing at a river or at the sea, and having water sounds cleaning out all the unnecessary information from them. The native in such case should use such places as meditation spots, and he would  usually find them near his residence, taking frequent quick walks or drives to relax. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:44:49'),
(1590, 0, 'us', 'sun-in-3rd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving the Sun in the 3rd house means being born a little bit after the middle of the night, and when the Sun is placed here it is blending its energy with the characteristics of Mercury and Gemini. This is a very good natal placement and will definitely give a vivid everyday routine, making the small things of life exciting. \n \n\n\nAs the 3rd house is ruling intelligence, the presence of the sky’s brightest object is empowering all affairs ruled by the house. These areas are becoming the basis of the native’s existence, a very important part of their life and development. A child born under this natal aspect will be an early bloomer, considering his intellectual skills. He will start talking early and be rather talkative and hyper-energetic. The immediate surroundings are for it an amazing place to discover, and his natural curiosity will drive him to learn quickly through action and observation.\nAs the child grows and goes to school, he will probably excel in it even if the Sun is poorly aspected. The child regards knowledge as something it can be proud of, and does not hesitate to show off his abilities, sometimes making it a smart-aleck. Such people love books and continue to self-educate during their whole life. Nevertheless, this placement does not necessary indicate higher education; if his 9th house does not contain planets or is otherwise strong he will prefer to acquire knowledge on his own without getting involved in a school of thought. This placement is very good for teachers, journalists, advertisers and writers, but does not create university professors or academics.\nThe native who has the Sun in the third house will probably have at least one sibling and it will be a male. In any case, the siblings take the character of his father and are heavily emphasized in his life. When the Sun is located in the third house, and especially near the beginning of the 4th house, the chart owner is a rather domestic person who desires a family. As the fourth house cusp (also called nadir of the natal chart or Imum Coeli, IC ) is the roots and the family, the individual regards family affairs as the most important thing in life. This is his inner stability, and his dream is to continue with creating his own offsprings. This natal placement empowers relations with cousins and if the Sun is well aspected it can hold the whole kin together; there will be frequently events where a lot of relatives see each other and experience a wonderful atmosphere.\nThe Sun in the third house makes communication rather important, and the native will be quite involved in speaking with people from his immediate surroundings. This placement creates a person who likes to take the initiative and get to know his neighbors, creating a positive atmosphere for everyone who lives nearby. There is a possibility of organizing events in the neighborhood or even taking part in groups that promote the development of the area. \n \n\n\nAs the third house is ruling short journeys, the native will constantly visit nearby places. This will even become a part of his weekly routine, and he will develop a tight bonding to certain areas that are not very far from his residence. They will be an important part of his inspiration, while by observing which house cusp lays inside the sign of Leo we can see which other area of his life will be affected by these journeys. The Sun will definitely bring a lot of happiness through these trips, and the native will be always returning shinier. This is a good placement for issues connected with transportation and his travels will be rather safe; except of course if the Sun is adversely afflicted by Mars or Uranus. From the young ages, the native develops a strong bonding with transportation vehicles; this placement creates the child that knows all the types of cars and dreams of becoming an adult and owning one. Indeed, when the native becomes of age, he will fulfill his dreams and acquire the desired vehicle. There can be a strong emotional bond with it, and the native will give a lot of love and care to his car. This placement creates the person that will be frequently washing it in his back yard, and the car becomes a source of pride and self-esteem.\nAs with most planets in the third house, there is a tendency to gossip; this should be generally avoided, but take some extra care if you see that your natal Sun has negative aspects- especially with planets located in the 12th house. There is nothing wrong with natural curiosity, this can be a wonderful power pushing you towards learning about all the fields of life; on the other hand when planets from the 12th house square your Sun you can create enemies by accidentally or deliberately revealing their secret information. And don’t forget, the 12th house rules your secrets too, so if you want them kept inside that box do not open boxes of others! \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:46:07'),
(1591, 0, 'us', 'sun-in-8th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatives who have their natal Sun placed in the 8th house are illuminating the obscure meanings of death, sex and the occult. No matter which their Sun sign is, they become quite Scorpionic in their character, have deep desires and a very strong will. For them, power is very important while sex is a mystical experience of death and rebirth.\nThis Sun placement creates an urge to go deep into the mysteries of life and death. Such individuals are very interested in discovering the meanings of life, constantly seeking for answers on whether death is the final destination or we continue towards somewhere else. These interests make them attracted to the occult, and they can reach tremendous knowledge about such kind of issues. Observing the big picture of how life functions makes them difficult to be satisfied by common experience and everyday reality. Nevertheless, this placement attracts a lot of supernatural experiences, and many of them are permanently transforming them. Everything that is unexplored or taboo for the masses, fascinates them and attracts them. This is also a reason for the masses to slightly fear them, or consider them morbid and dark.\nA person with the Sun in the 8th house will live many lives in one. These lives can be experienced either one after the other, or even simultaneously. It feels like being a protagonist in different movies, and because every movie has different surroundings and concept, the native is a totally different person in each one. While transcending from the one life to the other, the person can experience powerful dissolutions of his ego, and each death of his temporary persona is simulating real death. An 8th house Sun person has many ways of simulating death, in order to get acquainted with the biggest mystery and prepare himself to experience it. Other people might think that such natives are not afraid of death. Of course, this is not a right view. People with Sun in the house of death, are either consciously or unconsciously following the eastern orthodox proverb: \n \n\n\n“Die before you die, so that you don’t die when you die.”\nA curious fact is that the individual may achieve fame and success after his death. His death might be theatrical, phantasmagorical or dramatic. There are possibilities of leaving legacies towards the masses. This placement can be present in writers and artists that have their work more recognized after their death than during their lives.\nThe Sun in the 8th house, which is responsible for other people’s money, loans and inheritances, is quite good for the native’s finances. Large amounts of wealth can come in their hands after the death of their father, or another father figure. It is very frequent that they lose their father while they are still young in age. When the Sun is in Leo sign, then most times the native&#8217;s father dies from a heart attack. The Sun placed there makes them great in handling other people’s money, or even governmental. For such natives, it is quite easy to get a loan from a bank, provided that Sun does not have adverse aspects from Mars, Saturn or Pluto. In such occasions, natives are advised to not indulge in taking loans; they might easily receive one but have tremendous difficulties in paying it back.\nThey are very magnetic and seductive; their sexuality is as intense as a Scorpio’s. The Sun in the latter part of the 8th house makes sex a religion for them. Such people are feeling becoming gods through sexual activities, and are also creating a God/Goddess of their partner. For them, eroticism is art, expression and meditation. Their bed is an altar, and every sexual act is a ritual. The same attributes appear to people that have the Sun in the first part of the 8th house, with the difference that they are concentrating on their partner, and not on the idea itself. Their sexual evolution is strongly connected with bonding to their significant other (ruled by the yth house). They are aiming in uniting the two souls into one body, and reaching the perfect creature by abolishing duality. On the other hand, whoever has his Sun near the 9th house cusp is more interested in higher and more abstract meanings about sex, which makes less necessary the unification with one particular other soul. \n \n\n\nThe 8th house is an open gate to the other realms, and when one’s Sun resides in the house it can grant him psychic abilities. The native is very perceptive and his intuition is usually right. They can read people through peering in their eyes, and are very difficult to trick or swindle due to strong defenses. Sun in the 8th house makes a person suspicious, with paranoiac tendencies. Their emotions can reach enormous heights, and so can their orgasms in sex. The 8th house has no borders when one manages to pass its gates. What lays outside, is just infinite, and we are so small in front of it. That is the main reason of fears and taboos created by 8th house issues. They are just locks, keeping the gates shut for the unprepared. The ones who are ready, can handle situations that exceed the 5 senses and 4 primary dimensions. And the 8th house Sun people, are born ready. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:46:14'),
(1592, 0, 'us', 'sun-in-1st-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving the Sun in the first house is being born right before sunrise, and from the ancient years it was believed that it is a good omen for the newborn’s life. The rising Sun located in the first house grants its light to the person’s body and character, making the native a beautiful person with a strong presence among others. This aspect empowers self-confidence and helps projecting power towards others; the native is a born leader and the masses find in him the bright light that they yearn to follow.\nThe strong leadership abilities are a result of the Sun’s presence in the traditional house of Aries; the Sun in the 1st house is a fighter, always willing to reach out and fight for the goals that the native establishes.  Furthermore, if the Sun is located in a fiery and masculine sign as for example Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, the native’s abilities become even stronger. A problem that he might encounter is become overbearing towards others and extremely arrogant. Pride is another trait that should be held under control, as the Rising Sun has a lot of tendencies towards Luciferian Pride. Being proud of one’s self is by no means bad; nevertheless letting this feeling uncontrolled can devour other positive behaviors that the native possesses.\nAs the first house is responsible for the body, the presence of Sun gives good health, even if it is poorly aspected. In such situations, even when the native’s body malfunctions and health issues appear, the Sun helps him recuperate quickly and be very robust. The individual’s general optimism and positive approach towards health problems is a factor that largely contributes to his vitality. The native with such a placement tends to care about his body, exercises frequently and generally chooses a lifestyle that keeps his body in a good condition till his old ages. A Rising Sun person is usually tall and strong; most of the times he looks very similar to his father. The father is frequently a respected person of authority, and the child is copying his character. The father-child relationship is a very good one, there exists a lot of admiration and respect and the father becomes the main role model for the child.\nA first house Sun person is very interested in expressing himself. This is usually also connected to his physical appearance, interests and activities. He feels the urge to shine like the Sun and be adored by the rest of the world. Being adored and followed is very important for his self-confidence, and so he strives to develop a personal style and approach to life. He does not like copying other individuals and feels uncomfortable to follow trends; a first house Sun person is the beginning of a trend himself. Their brave character, their optimism and competitiveness usually grant them high positions from their early years. They will usually be the most excelling children in school, the strongest in the sports team, the most respected at work. The Sun helps them evolve early in their life and many people with such a Sun position can already be successful before they reach the age of 30.\nThey possess the ability to seize opportunities and generally be in the right place in the right time; the Sun shines a lot of luck on them. If there exist any positive aspects with Venus and Jupiter, their luck is even bigger and people can get magnetized by their smile and warm presence. Such type of natives can get a job by just radiating warmth in the interview. \n \n\n\nAll the people that have their Sun in the first house, have their zodiac sign highly emphasized in their chart. Most of them have the same Sun sign and Rising sign, but even those who do not, have their chart dominated by this Sun.  Usually, Mercury and Venus are also somewhere around, giving more possibilities of creations of Stelliums (3 or more planets close to each other), which in turn make the native’s character very unique and powerful. It is pretty safe to state, that all the people with the Sun rising in their chart cannot pass unnoticed; each of them has a powerful presence- of course of different flavor. \n \n\n\nThe only advice that such an individual should follow is to practice humility and battle pride. It is quite an easy change for a good leader to become tyrannical, for a successful person with a lot of altruism to start forgetting about the people that are less strong than him. If you want to make the world continue to worship you, you should not forget getting in the world’s shoes once in a while. The good leader is the one that is followed by choice and not the one that is feared of. If you really want to be a Sun for other people, do not forget to warm them. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:46:26'),
(1593, 0, 'us', 'sun-in-2nd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving the Sun in the house of material possessions and wealth, makes the natal chart owner be strongly connected to his belongings. Indeed, the Sun is responsible for one’s personal shining, and depending on where it is placed in the native’s chart makes the life departments ruled by the placement very important for him.\nPossessing brings to such a person pride, providing him security on which he can later build on. Especially in a man’s horoscope, the Sun placed there makes belongings really important for his self esteem. In a woman’s the effects are similar, although a little lighter. In addition, she might have the strong need to be proud of her father’s power and prosperity, as the Sun is representing the father in a chart. \n \n\n\nThe Sun fixed in the Second definitely helps with finances. A lot of money will channel through the native’s hands, as would a Jupiter or a Venus bring also. Nevertheless, the Sun is not only an attractor of wealth as the other two, but also a big spender. It radiates from the second house, tending to shine on other celestial bodies connected with aspects and located in other house, empowering those house’s issues. Observing to which planets there exists an aspect, the native can see which areas of life will both bring and demand flows of wealth, and a careful look on them can make them more careful in how they structure their expenses.\nSecond house Sun natives tend to over-identify what they are, with what they have. This can lead to a life of seeking constant material growth, without paying the necessary attention to spiritual one. This can in particular be noted when a stellium of more planets is present in the house; the person can become a pure materialist, dedicating a large part of his time in obtaining riches and power. If the stellium is in Scorpio, this urge for possessing blends with jealoucy of others. The presence of  other adverse aspects can make the way of obtaining them be quite dubious, hidden or immoral. \n \n\n\nIn case such a native develops his own morality and value system, the positive attributes of the Sun will grant him even more self-sufficiency. A pattern frequently observed is that a second house Sun person is a very stable friend, granting help to the close people when needed, most usually financial or material. Their friends are also seen as posessions by them, and their natural need of maintaining them can actually be of great help to the friends theselves.\nSuch type of natives can be obsessed with collecting posessions. These objects could be both of value and of beauty. Venus being near the natal Sun would definitely pull the chart owner to beautiful antiques, decorative objects and other collectibles that would pleasure both his eyes, and be an investment in wealth. In case that Libra is on the house’s cusp, the possibility of chasing and obtaining beauty and art objects is really high.\nAn issue that such a native might have to deal with is possessiveness, as he uses everything he owns or feels that owns for creating his identity. When a material object, a person or something else considered a possession seizes to exist, the native can experience difficulties in restructuring his self-esteem. He instead should concentrate in using his resources with respect and constructively, valuing them and understanding that instead of filling emotional voids he can use the for reaching higher personal levels. They are a blessing that when used correctly can bestow further light both on him and the people near him.\nSearch for transiting triangles from Jupiter or other slow moving planets to understand when the Sun is to be positively activated. Usually such periods bring a rise in one’s assets, while other natural outcomes are spending a lot more in good food, clothes and well-living. Of course it can at the same time boost arrogance and pride. A tine transit from Pluto can drastically change the chart owner’s financial situation forever, raising both his assets and status. The opposite could be created with a square, although in both cases other connections to bodies must also be counted. The ruler of the second house and his condition are very important, as they will define the scale in which the wealth calibrations will be applied. If it is Jupiter or Venus, the native will have luck pushing him even more in his financial affairs.\nThe Sun in the second house can give a tendency to the native of leaving his studies incomplete. This can be connected with no real need of receiving education, because wealth is either already present through the parents, or money are generated through means that do not involve a lot of intellectual work.\nThe native’s father could be a great financial support to the native, literally building for him both his property and his career. The children born under such placements are often used to having everything they need, becoming spoiled and taking belongings as granted. This is not negative necessarily; such kind of people can have a very prosperous childhood without any kind of financial problems of the family. The father might be over-concerned with wealth, passing the same attitude to the child, but if the aspects of other planets are positive then the native will rather benefit from both the father’s approach to wealth, and his own. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:46:32'),
(1594, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-12th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nAn individual with natal Moon in the 12th house is always extremely sensitive to external currents, highly intuitive and with a tendency to hide their emotions. This placement can make the individual quite vulnerable, but also bring gifts of clairvoyance.\nThe 12th house is traditionally ruled by Pisces and Neptune, a sign and planet that are rather passive and feminine, deeply connected with water. The Moon is strongly connected with the water triplicity as it rules Cancer, and is not debilitated as it does in fiery placements. Nevertheless, as the 12th house is the Achilles’ heel of the natal chart, such a placement can be even quite dangerous and troublesome. \n \n\n\nThe gates towards other realities are quite open when the Moon is placed in the 12th, and this is strengthened even more if it is in a water sign. This fact by itself is rather neutral; yet the aspects that the Moon receives from other planets play a huge role. A well-aspected Moon will create a psychic with strong healing abilities who unconditionally helps other people, while an adversely aspected one can trigger quite a lot of phobias, depression and lead to emotional isolation.\nA 12th house Moon grants the native powers of osmosis towards the feelings of the people that surround him. The individual will have antennas, always receiving the mood that hovers and making him rather empathetic to all those who suffer. The sentimental character of the native will make him strive to help people who he regards as martyrs; on the other hand he may be frequently becoming a martyr himself through giving a lot towards others and not caring about himself.\nPeople with such a placement should be very careful when dealing with hypnosis or other techniques that can involve manipulation of the mind and subconscious messages. They are usually the easiest subjects to hypnotize, and actually can even follow orders without having to fall in a trance/hypnotic condition to receive them. The Moon in the sky can act as a hypnosis pendulum, so they should especially be very careful in such occasions, while also sleep with their curtains closed as the moonlight may lead them to sleep-walk or indulge in other activities they will not remember later.\nThe Moon in the twelfth house can bring quite a lot of fears, usually connected with emotional issues. The native may be afraid of being abandoned by people of his life, which may frequently make him get closed in his own shell. He might pass long periods away from people, just to not get too close and experience fears of losing them. These matters are usually echoes of childhood fears connected with the native’s mother. The mother may have been subconsciously perceived as an enemy during the native’s young years, and may have had very mutable mood, depressive tendencies or even hysteria. In addition, she might have been hospitalized quite a lot in her life, while also been in prison, monastery or other institution of seclusion. \n \n\n\nThe native’s imagination is very strong, and he will be many times daydreaming. The Moon placed there can disturb his sleep, bringing quite a lot of dreams which in case of bad aspects may be nightmares. In addition, many nights can be sleepless and full of thoughts, sometimes melancholic. If you have this placement you might discover monthly recurring patterns of difficult nights, either connected with the full Moon or when it transits its natal position.\nPeople with Moon in the twelfth may not control their emotions easily, and they will many times overflow as the sea’s tides. Fragile and withdrawn, they are very easily hurt even if they will not express their pain. On the other hand, this overabundance of Lunar energy can make them strong healers, especially through nurturing other people. In many occasions it can also bring a job that involves caring; we should not forget that the 12th house rules all institutions, hospitals and clinics. The Moon in the 12th house can make someone a nurse, a cook or elsehow bring job in such places of restriction. This will mostly happen if the 6th or 10th house cusps are placed in Cancer.\nAs the 12th house is responsible about hidden enemies, a person whose Moon is afflicted by malefics like Mars, Saturn or Pluto will have repeating situations of female enemies. These might not be perceived as hostile in the beginning, and will be frequently viewed as friends even if they are already backstabbing the individual. If you have this placement, keep an eye on doubtful females (or people of strong Cancer/Moon emphasis) but try to not become paranoid, for it may furthermore alienate you from social life. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:47:06');

A well-aspected Moon is great for socializing, while difficult aspects may create quite a lot of issues concerning oversensitivity.\nWhen the Moon is located in the house of groups, it will bring a lot of females as friends. The feminine energy will be prevailing in organizations that the native is a part of, and the overall atmosphere of group activities will be rather sentimental. The friends and the native have an intense emotional need of belonging to a group, and social gatherings nourish them. As the Moon and sign Cancer are traditionally ruling the 4th house which represents one’s home, the groups will frequently gather at the members’ apartments so that the atmosphere is cozy.\nIf the Moon is adversely aspected, too much emotion may create disturbances in such groups. There are possibilities of quarrels between the native and female friends, or being witness of tension between female participants of these groups. When the Moon is afflicted, it can lead to hysterical reactions and other mental outbursts towards and from friends. Usually, such reactions are quickly forgotten; the Moon is the quickest celestial body and its movement’s results do not last long. \n \n\n\nDue to the same reason, the native will probably change quite a lot of friends; the Moon is constantly bringing new acquaintances. The old ones tend to fade exactly as the Moon wanes before completing its monthly cycle. An eleventh house Moon signifies a rather quick appearance of enthusiasm towards new friends, without previously knowing well the other person. Friendships are mostly built through intuition but seldom last for long; the wave of emotions will eventually disappear. On the other hand, this placement gives a high possibility of rebirth of old friendships. This might follow very strange patterns; the native may even forget a person for some years and suddenly start hanging out every day, as if time has not passed since their previous common experiences.\nAn individual with such a natal placement does not like loneliness; if the Moon is not fed by indulging in group activities the native will eventually slide towards depression. There is a constant need for being around lots of people, and in some situations when the native’s Moon is in Scorpio or conjunct Pluto he might be even vampirizing on the group’s energy. This may be done unconsciously and is not necessarily unethical: the native might only feel he has a strong need to be around others and is not always able to understand that his presence is drinking them. \n \n\n\nGenerally, an 11th house Moon gives an unstable social life which also has influences in the inner sentimental condition of the individual. He can be quite moody and does not actually know what to seek from his friendships. His friends might be the best for killing time; on the other hand unless the Moon is supported by more stable planets the friendships remain rather shallow.\nIn case that the Moon is well-aspected, the native may be part of groups of an altruistic direction and benevolent causes. Such a placement can lead to voluntary work connected to caretaking, and is especially linked to offering food to the homeless and poor, while also nursing. A woman with natal Moon in the 11th house may join the Red Cross or some similar organization that aids people of need or refugees.\nAs the 11th house is also signifying help from friends, any individual with a well-aspected Moon will be aided a lot by females. In the initial stages of the native’s life the mother is more regarded as a friend than as a parent, which eventually creates a friendly pattern towards all people with prevailing feminine energy. Thus, female friends may help very much both financially and with career issues.\nIf you have the Moon placed here, you should always remember that the best thing is to not depend too much on other people, as in the end you start to dissolve your personality and receive traits that are not yours. With such a placement, the best is to find the golden balance between yourself and others, as in the end this will enhance your dealings with them. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:47:11'),
(1596, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-10th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen a native has natal Moon in the 10th house, he is feeling rather emotional about his public image and is overly concerned about how other people perceive him. This placement can be quite good for all female type jobs, while can also bring fame- even temporarily.\nThe Moon is in detriment in the 10th house, because the house’s ruler is Capricorn; the sign that opposes Cancer, the natural realm of the Moon. Thus, even a well-aspected Moon will function in weakened ways. Nevertheless, it is still a good placement, and can even bring fame and a good public image. As the Moon is the quickest celestial object, the benefits it grants to the house matters are of a fluctuating nature and do not last long. The positive thing is that the Moons quick movement may make them easily reappear; of course to wane away again, exactly as the phases of the Moon.\nThe 10th house is ruling the dominant parent of the native, and the presence of the Moon indicates that his mother is a rather strong character, frequently absent from home due to career-related issues. In addition, she may have attributes of a public figure and somehow dealing with masses. This placement can indicate a general high position of the family in the social system and the native is being taught from his young years that prestige and recognition are very important. The dominant parent may be a Cancer sign person or elsehow have the Moon strongly emphasized in the natal chart. \n \n\n\nA tenth house Pluto can act exceedingly well in charts of people that interconnect with masses and audiences. It is very positive for politicians, spokespersons while also artists who perform on stage. Generally, the Moon is rather unstable and can bring a lot of changes to the native’s career. He may change a lot of them, and even when decides to do something permanently it will surpass a lot of transformations. There will not exist a steady pattern of business growth and both the income and the success will be of a mutable nature. The profession will not be so dependant on the efforts of the individual but rather on external currents and trends that are highly uncontrolled. More effort will not mean more success, and less effort will not mean failure. His occupation will be just like fishing; no matter how much dedicated or good the fisherman is, there are other factors that decide if there will be a good catch. \n \n\n\nAs the Moon is ruling the 4th house and the family’s roots, when located in the 10th it can grant a family business which the native is called to continue keeping as a tradition. Due to the Moon’s rulership of food and cooking, this placement gives a high possibility for the family business to be a traditional restaurant passing through the kin’s generations. In addition, the Moon can bring an occupation connected with women; alternate explanations is that the native will have women as co-workers or bosses and that he will be generally aided a lot by females in structuring his career.\nThe Moon is the celestial body ruling one’s emotions, and when configured in the 10th house it will definitely make the native be sentimentally connected to his work. His successes are received with great pleasure, while any possible failures can easily hurt his feelings. Such a placement gives a quite strong charisma, even in front of cameras. On the other hand, an afflicted Moon by Mars, Saturn or Pluto can give a lot of worries concerning the native’s work and public image, which in turn can even lead towards hysterical outbursts. Another issue that might occur is hasty business decisions, mostly based on emotional insights than sheer logic and strategy. These can be of a quite detrimental nature for the job progress, and such a person should always have a more stable advisor who can view a different perspective and halt the native before acting carelessly. \n \n\n\nSuch a natal placement is also good for occupations that have to do with nurturing. Especially in female natal charts, the Moon will create a good caretaker. People who have the Moon here may become good nurses, hotel managers, stewards and generally offer services that involve offering and serving others.\nThe Moon in the 10th house is very vulnerable to negative criticism, and the individual’s emotions are easily hurt. Such people can hold grudges towards others that make negative comments, while an adverse aspect with Pluto or Mars can give a quite revengeful character. There can be traumas concerning insecurity about work, and even the slightest negative comment can be felt as being poked on the wound. The native is too much concerned about what the others say about him, which can quite a lot drain his energy. The best advice for a tenth house Moon person is to ignore the opinions of others, no matter if they are good or bad and concentrate on what he really does. Dealing with your emotions during your working hours will simply devour a great amount of time which could be used for working and progressing.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:47:15'),
(1597, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-8th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen a person has his natal Moon in the 8th house, his mind can transcend to the outer realms quite easily, making it possible to manipulate energy for magical use. There will be a constant battle between darkness and light in the native’s mind, as the Moon here will many times express its dark side. \n \n\n\nThe Moon is the quickest celestial body, and its placement in the 8th house indicates quite a lot of sexual partners. This does not mean that the native will have a lot of casual sex; quite the contrary is what happens. The native desires emotional security, and its placement in the eighth house will make him yearn for deep feelings. There can be some sort of insecurity concerning sex, and the native may quickly rush into relationships, in order to feel nurtured. The Moon can bring very romantic relations, but the quick nature of the Earth’s satellite may make romances end rather soon and bring new ones.\nThe native with the Moon in the eighth house will frequently feel sexual unrest; his mind will be always yearning for something more, for something deeper. This can be a reason for him abandoning- or being abandoned by partners; feelings fluctuate really fast. A person with such a placement will be fascinated rather quickly by something new, especially if it is forbidden or secret. The Moon is capable of bringing intense feelings, yet they can fade away the same easily. As the 8th house is ruled by Scorpio and Pluto, the Moon inherits a lot of their traits. The Moon does not feel comfortable in the realm of Scorpio and tends to show its cruel face, expressing jealousy, suspicion and obsession.\nHaving the Moon in the house of secrets will make curiosity an important trait of one’s personality. He will be interested in the mysteries of life and death, while also about anything taboo. If natal Moon is in a water sign, the person will have quite a lot of psychic abilities, being even capable of psychic vampirism. In case that the Moon is in Scorpio, the native can become a sexual vampire, and with adverse aspects from other planets he may frequently use such powers in order to absorb the energy of his partners. This can be done unconsciously, and seem to the native as a thirst for deep feelings. In case you have such aspects, try getting into introspection and analyze your relationships. You might understand that a lot of problems have appeared in your relations, and if you are true to yourself you will observe that you are a big source of them. Stop vampirizing on others, as the difficult aspects of this placement will have an adverse effect on your own life, and more particularly in the life areas represented by the houses where the planets aspecting the Moon are located.\nAs the native’s gates to the other realms are widely opened, there can be danger of being vampirized too. This will frequently happen if the Moon is located in some passive sign, such as Pisces, Cancer or Libra. With these placements the native will generally be very emotional, and very sensitive to vibes from other people. His intuition is strongly developed and can receive a lot of information through dreams, oracles or other types of insight. These abilities are inherited from the native’s mother, and generally pass through the female line of ancestors. With the Moon in the 8th house, there are even possibilities of communication with the deceased. In some cases, such an aspect can indicate an early loss of the mother or some other important female figure in the native’s life.\nThe 8th house represents the finances of an individual’s marriage partner. With the Moon placed in the house, the spouse’s finances will be of a fluctuating nature, following the phases of the Moon. This placement does not indicate someone rich, unless supported by other benefics. On the other hand, it is neither an indicator of poverty; the Moon tends to create an average wealth which does not cumulate.\nThe 8th house is ruling legacies, and the presence of the Moon will bring an inheritance, usually from a female person. The financial value of the legacy might not be very big, but will definitely have a large impact on the person’s sentiments. \n \n\n\nIf you have this natal placement, you should be very careful of any occult powers that you possess. The dark side of the Moon is easily awakened in you, and you will be frequently tempted to do malice instead of good. This placement is frequent in people (especially females) that are into sorcery and witchcraft. There might be a tradition in your family of following such dark roads, and it is in your hands now to break it. Do not forget that you have the ability to choose your own destiny in this incarnation, and dissolve any poisonous attributes that have passed to you from previous lives or your ancestral lineage. Be good, and the Moon will reward you with its shining side.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written! \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:47:19'),
(1598, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-6th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen the Moon is located in the 6th house of a natal chart, its swift motion can bring frequent changes in jobs that the native follows. This placement creates the workaholic and the person that sticks to a daily routine, while is also probably the best for a cook.\nThe Moon is the celestial body responsible for food and its preparation; thus a native with the Earth’s satellite in the house of work will probably choose such an occupation. This placement does not have to do only with cooking, though. It can bring jobs connected with packaging food, grocery stores, hotels, catering, fast food and others. The Moon does not provide a lot of stability, and this individual will experience a lot of changes of workplaces. In a woman’s chart this could also signify other kinds of domestic work like cleaning other people’s houses, while also not working and being a housewife at home. The sixth house is also responsible for service towards others, and the Moon can signify that the native as a nurturing parent will sacrifice his work in order to serve his children at home. Such people usually love cleaning and do not considering it boring.\nAs the 6th house is ruling one’s health, the Moon’s presence can make the stomach of the native weak. The native may have problems with digestions, while with hard aspects there might be problems with ulcers. Generally, the native’s digestion system is directly linked to his emotions, ruled by the Moon, and so stress and worries can have a direct effect on it. The best remedy is something simple, yet many times difficult to achieve: the native needs to relax and take his problems less seriously. In case that the Moon has an adverse aspect with Mars, there may be possibilities of having an operation connected to the stomach; people with this placement should check their health frequently.\nThe Moon placed in the 6th can make a person hypochondriac, and when harsh aspects exist to Mercury or Uranus the native will have delusions of being sick and constantly complaining to others just to gain their attention. There is a quite big risk that his hysteric approach towards health issues will in the end create some, probably of different type than the ones he thinks he has. This situation can get even worse, if the native uses the problems that appear in order to justify himself towards his surroundings. In the end, the whole thing might end up as a self-fulfilling prophecy, with the native vampirizing the other’s sympathy and even showing affection towards his sickness. An adversely aspected Moon can become even affectionate to such kind of a problem. \n \n\n\nThe sixth house is ruling one’s routines, and this natal placement indicates a person who is very fond of his own. These natives have their own daily rituals and follow them. They usually wake up at the same time in the morning and also sleep at the same time in the night. They like building nutrition schedules and will probably follow some special diet. There are even big possibilities that their job will be the one of a dietician. In their job they are workaholics, and this might be an archetype they caught from their mother. The 6th house indicates a mother who was a great housekeeper, making the native’s home functioning as a clock and always doing something. This is copied by the small child and is used later in his life subconsciously. \n \n\n\nSome issues that a native with such a 6th house Moon should be careful about is his depressive tendencies. The Moon in this house does not indicate chronic depression, but there will be definitely some days per month when the native will be feeling low. These days are connected with the phases of the Moon, and if the native researches possible patterns that reappear he will understand how it functions, while even be able to battle it. In case that the Moon has difficult aspects with Saturn, Mars or Uranus, the native should be more careful about his mental health as these can be indicators of bipolar disorder or other types of mental problems.\nIn addition, when someone has the Moon placed in the 6th there can be proneness to be used by his co-workers. The native is very hard-working, which is observed by the others and so they tend to procrastinate and let the biggest amount of work fall on his shoulders. In case you have this natal placement and understand that you are being used, stop feeling so affectionate about your job and become a little bit fairer towards yourself. It is not only the co-worker’s fault, it is also yours that you allow him do that. Worry a little bit more about your own health; it is more important than the prosperity of your employer. It is your stomach that will have problems, not your employers’, if you are in a constant stress!\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written! \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:47:25'),
(1599, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-5th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving your Moon in the house of love, recreation and children is quite a good natal placement. The house is traditionally ruled by Leo and the Sun; thus the Moon is illuminated and very active, while also can behave in a rather theatrical way. \n \n\n\nAs the 5th house is ruling children, the presence of the Moon makes a native rather fertile. In case that the Moon is also located in a fruitful sign such as Taurus, Cancer, Pisces, Scorpio or Sagittarius, the native has even more possibilities of having children. The Moon, in most cases, gives a female first child. In any case, the child will have a very strong Cancer/Moon emphasis in its natal chart, and will be very sentimental and emotional. \n \n\n\nGenerally, the native with such a natal placement of the Moon will love children, and will be very fond of the children of his friends and relatives. The children also show a lot of joy when playing with him, and can establish a very good communication. Such people keep in touch with the child inside them, and thus are easily recognized by children as “one of their own”. In addition, this natal placement of the Moon makes the native look some years younger than his real age.\nSuch kinds of people adore activities that are connected with cooking. A big party with a lot of food, or going out with a bunch of friends to a restaurant is something that will make them delighted. They adore to do barbeques, family reunions and generally gathering a lot of near-to-the-heart people in some place where they can eat, drink, talk and have lots of fun.\nThe 5th house is the house of love, flirting and casual sex. The Moon is the fastest celestial object and brings a lot of flirting and a playful attitude in the erotic life of the native. People with this placement are rather moody and prefer an unstable sexual life. They can have multiple partners in the same period; this does not though mean that they do not develop emotions towards them. Actually, with the Moon present here, the native might be constantly in love with “being in love”. So, he mostly seeks the joy of feeling emotions and attraction towards another person- and it is quite natural that such kinds of emotions develop simultaneously for more than one person.\nTheir love affairs are both intense and sentimental, and can even lead to dramatic- nearly theatrical situations. For sure, their love life is never something boring. In a man&#8217;s chart, there are possibilities of him prefering quite younger women, especially as he grows older. If the Moon is adversely aspected he should be very careful of such relationships, as they might end up dramatically and bring catastrophes.\nEven if people with the Moon in the 5th house have artistic abilities, the way they express themselves through art is frequently changing. The native will have creative hobbies, but this moody approach towards different techniques and arts is not the most helpful for becoming an established artist. A person with such an aspect will lack the necessary discipline, keeping art mostly as a hobby.\nIn case that the Moon is adversely afflicted, the native should guard against gambling. This natal placement makes gambling a joy for the native, and the best thing to do is somehow disconnect the activity from his wealth. As the reason for him to gamble is not to gain money but the sheer activity of waiting for the outcome and celebrate a possible victory, it is a very wise decision to find ways to gamble that cannot threaten his pocket. Instead of betting on those horse-rides gather your friends at home and have a game of cards, where whoever loses buys the pizzas or washes the dishes. The amounts of endorphin you will produce will be exactly what your organism yearns for, without taking a risk that might challenge your wallet.\nIn general, this natal aspect creates the hedonist. The person strives to find emotional joy, and probably had a lot of joy in his childhood (of course except if the Moon was adversely aspected by malefics). Also, he loved his mother, played with her and received a lot of joy and care. This is another natal placement that gives a good childhood, full of games and fun. In addition, it is very prominent that the first love will happen in the really young ages of the native. It can be in the kindergarten or in the first grades of school, but usually does not flourish. In any case, the child experiences a very deep and romantic attraction to another child, while other children of that age have not yet developed towards a state of being able to perceive something like that. \n \n\n\nIf your Moon is in the 5th house, you will probably be untidy and despise doing the housework. You like to be helped and served in all the matters concerning the house, and will frequently bring over friends to help you clean. On the other hand, cooking for others is an activity that falls in the totally opposite category: you can invest a lot of love an care in preparing food for the ones you love.\nTo conclude, a person with the Moon in the 5th house will be very fond of hugs and sweetness while in an affair. The sharing of warmth and emotions is something necessary for them, and even when they are not in some kind of a relationship they will frequently search for such types of situations. They might even invite some partner or ex-partner for a sleepover, which will not necessarily involve any sexual activity other than sharing a hug and sleeping together. Nurturing the ones he feels emotional to is a big priority.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written! \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:47:31'),
(1600, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-4th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen the Moon is located in the 4th house of a natal chart, its position is considered a very fortunate one. The 4th house is traditionally ruled by Cancer, and its ruling planet Moon, so the Earth’s satellite is actually residing at its own home. People whose Moon resides there are of the lucky ones to feel the mother love at its top.\nThis natal placement gives a sensitive, nourishing and emotional mother that gives a lot of care and tenderness to the native. She has a strong Cancer/Moon emphasis in her chart, great abilities of cooking, raising her children and housekeeping. This type of a mother will usually breastfeed her child longer than the others, and will continue cooking for the native even when he becomes an adult. There is a strong emotional bond between them, which continues as long as they are both alive. The native’s childhood was very secure, and he felt protected and safe in his mother’s hug. During his very early years, the individual with such a Moon position was constantly keeping in his mother’s hug; and such a close physical contact could continue even later. The native receives a lot of caress, tenderness and love; he thus develops a sentimental world of big capacity, which follows him during the rest of his life. \n \n\n\nBoth the native and his mother have a strong urge of living near the sea, a lake, a river or some other source of water. If the Moon is positioned in a water sign, this urge is even stronger and the native will not find content unless he fulfils this dream. Water brings much comfort to his private life, acts as a source of inspiration and provides a lot of energy which will be used for the family affairs and everyday home routines.\nThis Moon’s placement makes family and home a big priority in the chart holder’s life. Having a family brings to him emotional stability, and there is no way that such a native does not create one. Even if malefics in the 7th house obstruct him getting married, he will create something that will be structured as a family through some other way. The native will copy his mothers’ archetypal behavior and will also develop his cooking talents, while will also be fond of housekeeping. Nevertheless, the Moon does not provide a very stable residence; he and his family will be frequently moving and changing houses. \n \n\n\nPeople with their Moon positioned in the 4th house are feeling very sentimental about their roots and ancestors. Their memories are a very important part of their personality, and they will frequently feel nostalgic towards their past. Such kind of natives are prone to collecting photographs and categorizing them in albums, as well as keeping a lot of objects that remind them of people and situations. Usually, there exists some family heirloom which they keep with great respect and will pass to their offsprings. This heirloom can often be made of silver, or belong to the female ancestors, thus also passing to the female children of the line. There is a general attachment to the traditions, both of the family’s, the birthplace’s, the religion’s or the culture’s. Such kind of people will always take part in traditional events of their homeland, especially in food festivals and all which involve cooking. In addition, they keep their own recipes; this placement gives the pattern of having a grandmother and a mother that pass some very old recipe to the native. The person with Moon in the 4th house might be very attached emotionally to some special types of food that where cooked for him!\nPeople with the Moon in the 4th house do not indulge in casual relationships. They prefer stable and nurturing bonds, and will stick with a partner for long if the emotional needs are fulfilled. If the native is a man, the type of woman he is searching for getting into a relationship can be literally a copy of his mother. Men with such a strong placement of the Moon can be considered as unmasculine, nevertheless this does not have some special effect on their sexual orientation. This placement simply brings a lot of drinking of feminine energy from their mother, which can afterwards manifest through them even in their movements and way of speaking. And this is quite natural; we all tend to copy the moves and speech of people who we hang with. So, just imagine how much we can be affected by someone who is present during our whole life and feel such a strong emotional bond as to our mother! \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:47:36'),
(1601, 0, 'us', 'moon-in-9th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWith the Moon in the house of higher philosophy, the native develops high spiritual and moral values. This placement gives a person whose soul strives to feel, give and receive through religion, justice or spirituality. Their beliefs contain a lot of emotions, and this sensitivity towards what they believe as higher than them makes them dedicate to that cause.\nSuch a natal position of the moon can indicate moving to live to a different country than where the native is born. As the Moon rules the mother, there is a possibility of having a mother from a different nation, religion or race than the father. This position will definitely bring a foreigner as a husband or wife, if the cusp of the 7th house falls in Cancer sign. As the ninth house is also ruling traveling, the person who has such a placement will frequently travel to distant places, in which he will blend and interact with the foreign culture and empower his mind. Through such travels he can experience profound and life-changing illuminations and structuring a different philosophy of life.\nThe Moon in the ninth house creates a great listener. As the Moon is a passive and receptive planet, its position in the 9th house creates a very good receptor for information. The people who have this placement do not so much indulge in becoming a source of information. They listen a lot, but for the pleasure of receiving and not interacting. They are lifelong learners, and no matter how much they learn there is always a feeling of being unfulfilled. \n \n\n\nThe mother of the native with such a natal Moon may be felt somehow far, during the childhood. The child feels that although his mother is physically present, her mind is somewhere away, as if she is searching something else. There are possibilities of the mother being an academic, a writer, a judge or elsehow involved in those higher fields that the 9th house rules. The mother is many times showing less attention to the child while she concentrates on her 9th house activities. The Moon is also ruling food, so when it is present in the 9th house can give a love of foreign cuisine. Gastronomy in such occasions can even become an important reason for traveling to foreign lands; the native experiences the culture through food. He can even become very emotional about his favorite tastes and cuisines!\nThis natal Moon position gives a sensitive and receptive mind. It creates the dreamer and the visionary; the person wants to change the world and can be drawn into some good cause. On the other hand, the Moon is giving a rather unstable nature to the subjects of the house. The native might frequently change his mind and philosophy, or have multiple hobbies and switches from one to the other. This does not allow the native’s mind to fully concentrate on just one spiritual area; he becomes a thinker but never a knower. For him, this might be actually the best option; this way the native’s mind can travel and spread into a wider variety of subjects. This might reduce specialization, on the other hand will expand the interests. And for a 9th Moon native, boredom is a no-no. \n \n\n\nIn case that the native’s reality is pushy and he has not enough money to fulfill his travel needs, he simply pushes a button in his mind and disappears in thoughts. Natives with this placement have amazing abilities of visualizing imaginative stories; they can get frequently lost in lengthy fantasies that watch as movies in their heads. This magical placement is an open gate towards a more romantic, beautiful and exciting world, than the one who really exists. And if the person dreaming such dreams, has also other abilities… then who knows? He might even be able to materialize those illusions. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:47:45'),
(1602, 0, 'us', 'pluto-in-12th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWith natal Pluto in the 12th house, the chart owner will definitely experience a very intense life. This placement is a rather complex one, and is not the easiest to find. On the other hand, the transformation that it grants may evolve the native to a totally conscious human being with deep wisdom concerning life, death and existence.\nPluto is usually signifying a trauma connected with the house where it is placed in, and when in the 12th house it can indicate quite a lot of issues concerning the native’s subconscious. The twelfth house represents the last hours before birth, and Pluto’s presence may show a near-death experience of the infant native. There might be a lot of difficulties during labor, and the child might feel a lot of pain both before and during birth.\nAs the 12th house is also ruling secrets and hidden things, the individual with such a placement is strongly drawn towards them. He might be extremely curious in possessing answers for his questions, and can become an exquisite researcher or investigator. People with such an aspect will literally drink information to satisfy their curiosity, but will rarely speak themselves about their own secrets. \n \n\n\nAnd they might have a lot of them, especially connected with their sexuality. Pluto is representing a quite raw, aggressive and obsessive part of the human sexuality; while placed in the twelfth it can bring a lot of sexual fantasies- especially of a violent nature. If Pluto is adversely aspected, the native may have experienced sexual assault or even rape, which he usually will try to hide from everyone. People with such a natal Pluto might actually attract subconsciously such types of events, as such fantasies can simultaneously bring them lust and fear.\nOf course, in case that you have such an aspect, the best way to handle such raw energies is symbolically bring them to life with your significant other or a person you trust. In addition, an individual can develop strong masochistic tendencies if Pluto is adversely aspected by Saturn or Mars. Such aspects can be connected with deep psychological wounds from the childhood, and in case they are present in a natal chart the individual is advised to speak to a psychologist.\nAs the 12th house can have even an influence on one’s body (especially if a planet is near the Ascendant), Pluto can become even physically dangerous. The 12th house is an open gate, and an ill-aspected Pluto can indicate becoming victim of black magic, and generally having powerful enemies. If you have such a placement, keep in mind that 12th house enemies are usually hidden from our eyes; the best way to understand a Plutonian enemy is see who has a rather obsessive behavior towards us and reasons for being jealous and controlling. On the other hand, a well aspected Pluto here acts as a strong shield, which not only protects from hidden enemies but can also return them any attempts of causing malice.\nThe 12th house rules all types of restriction, whether it is in an institution or in one’s own mind. Pluto here can bring intense isolation from the rest of the world, especially when a slow-moving planet is forming a transiting aspect towards Pluto. During such periods, the native’s psychic ability is being strengthened, and he can understand a lot of the mind’s functions. The natal chart owner has abilities of re-programming his subconscious, and Pluto here will definitely bring transformative experience – usually concerning healing from traumas. The effects of such a healing will be permanent; yet the slow pace of Pluto indicates that a lot of time must be dedicated in order to fight one’s own demons. \n \n\n\nSuch a powerful planet in the 12th house shows a lot of behind the scenes activities, and to understand better how it functions one must observe which house cusp falls in Scorpio. In addition, aspects from Pluto to other natal planets will also indicate life areas where the native will operate secretly. In any case, Pluto placed here indicate high possibilities of secret sexual affairs. \n \n\n\nThe native will also have tendencies of oppressing anger, rage and wrath deep inside him. This placement indicates a lack of healthy externalization of these powers. Many times people with such placements will prefer to hide their real emotions; both due to fear of hurting others and of fearing to lose control. With this placement, an individual is obliged to find healthy ways to release such feelings. If he does not find, the Plutonian energy can erupt unexpectedly and very self-destructively.\nIn any case, this natal aspect may be one of the most difficult to handle. The dark traits of Pluto can be even hidden in the core of one’s existence, so tightly bonding with the general life perception that the only way is accepting them. The native with such a natal placement should invest a lot of effort into understanding his own self, especially the dark sides of his life and character. When he will see the big picture, and realize that even his darkness is a result of underground subconscious currents, he will finally find ways to accept it and embrace it.\nDo not forget to like our&nbsp;Facebook Page&nbsp;and join our&nbsp;Astrology Community Facebook Group&nbsp;to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:50:00'),
(1603, 0, 'us', 'pluto-in-11th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Pluto in the 11th house is a very intense natal placement, which can lead to dominating the masses or exercising various types of control to groups of people. Nevertheless, it is a rather tricky aspect, because if Pluto is ill-aspected then being a part of organizations can have a destructive effect on the native. \n \n\n\nPluto present in the house of friends and acquaintances will bring powerful people, rich and occupying authority positions. They can be of a rather obsessive nature, and if Pluto is adversely aspected their characters involve quite a lot of jealous and domineering traits. These friends may significantly aid the native in his career, especially if Pluto is located near the eleventh house cusp and thus also radiating into the 10th. Their wealthy financial state signifies that they will frequently help the native economically, although he should be very wary to ask for such things if Pluto is adversely aspected.\nThe reason behind this is that once these friends have aided the individual, they start to consider him as some kind of belonging and trying to exercise power over him. They believe that their actions should at least grant them a constant gratitude in return, and will even try to manipulate or elsehow use the native at their will. Always be careful while being around such people and never seek for help if your Pluto is in difficult aspects with Mars or Saturn. Such aspects to these malefics indicate that the powerful friends may have quite a lot of cruel characteristics hidden under the surface of their character. Do not indulge in power games with them, or be prepared to submit to them because they will not accept different outcomes than what they wish.\nThis Pluto placement can bring along the secrecy that the dark planet carries, and urge the native to join obscure organizations. He can become a member of secret societies which usually hold quite a lot of power or are orientated towards the occult. His experience inside such groups will be permanently transformative, for better or for worse – always depending on the aspects that natal Pluto receives. Usually, such groups provide no way out, so in case you have such a natal Pluto it is a wise advice to reconsider joining. Again, the same rule applies; do not even attempt it if Pluto is conjuncting, opposing or squaring Saturn or Mars. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, when an individual has a perfectly aspected Pluto, he will have a very important position behind the scenes and maybe even become a leader in such a group. His abilities of research into the occult are sharpened when surrounded by common-minded people in his workings. The involvement with secret societies will make him rise in power; both social, financial and magical.\nThis placement is great for politics, but mostly for shadowy positions inside the mechanism of the organization. The individual can reach tremendous levels of power without really being seen by the public; he can be even a lot stronger than the apparent leaders of the group. In some cases, he may be the one installing them as marionettes. Pluto in the 11th house makes a person a good tactician who can quickly understand the group dynamics, being able to exploit them for his own reasons.\nPluto in the 11th house can signify traumas concerning friendships in the early life of the native; hard aspects can even show a physical death of a good friend. Generally Pluto indicates some kind of permanent loss of a friend, and this makes the native obsessed with the idea of controlling the presence of friends in his life. That early separation makes the native see friendships as a very serious matter, and he pays a lot of attention in the details of such relations. There can exist a constant fear of losing friends or being expelled from groups, which will definitely make the native’s feelings more intense. This in turn can lead to him dedicating a major amount of time into his group activities, while also make him prone to being manipulated through threat of being abandoned.\nAnother matter that an 11th house Pluto person should be careful of is disputes with friends due to sexual reasons. Due to the fact that Pluto and Scorpio are strongly responsible of the darkest sexual attractions, this placement can even trigger wars between friends about a third person, who is often regarded as a sexual trophy. Many times, both sides are more interested in prevailing over each other than obtaining the trophy itself. Be wise enough to understand that such games do not lead somewhere and usually are destructive even for the winner. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:50:05');

(1604, 0, 'us', 'pluto-in-9th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving natal Pluto in the 9th house is a very powerful position, which can lead the native to profound discoveries of the secrets around how reality is functioning. Pluto here is capable to grant power over people, and the individual should be very careful to not misuse it.\nWhen Pluto is located in the house ruled by Sagittarius and Jupiter, his penetrative abilities to observe details are strongly expanded. This placement may make the individual follow the road of the scientist, as the 9th house is responsible for higher education. His studies can be connected with molecular biology, nuclear physics or anything else that has to do with research in depth and in detail.\nThe native has also great abilities of becoming a psychologist, mostly specialized in massive currents and phenomena than psychology of the individual. Pluto here can uncover the secrets of the mechanisms behind the collective unconscious; thus such a person should better invest his time in researching and writing theories of psychology than dedicate his life into healing people as a doctor. His role may be highly educative towards others; he can create a school of thought, become an academic and influence a lot of students. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, when Pluto is adversely aspected this placement can be very bad; yet not for the native himself but for other people. Pluto here can create the religious extremist, the narrow-minded fanatic who upon discovering his personal religious truths will try to impose them to others. A conjunction to Mars may lead him to even use all types of cruelty for promoting his ideas. If you have such a placement, always be careful about how you treat the ideas of other people.\nThe fact that you reached knowledge through research does not make your beliefs untouchable and de facto correct. Moreover, as spirituality is a very philosophical subject without concrete borders, sticking to a doctrine and becoming a fanatic of it does not lead you to a spiritual evolution. Battle your own pride, and understand that every other person has all the right to evolve the way he prefers, and not the way that you suggest. After all, religion and higher meanings is a rather personal thing. Be tolerant. \n \n\n\nAs the 9th house is ruling distant travels, the presence of Pluto will bring life-changing experiences through one’s journeys. This planet quite often signifies permanent relocation to a foreign country and generally makes the native transform totally after discovering a new country, religion or culture that he prefers. Distant journeys are for him an unquenchable thirst developed through his young ages, and might be an unattainable desire for long years due to poverty issues. Due to this fact, when the native finally turns his dream a reality and travels, he might be so fascinated by this change that will not want to return to his previous way of life. Living abroad usually becomes a life goal and an obsession. \n \n\n\nNatal Pluto in the 9th house can be prominent in charts of people who are interested in politics. There may exist a subconscious desire to control the masses through ideas, so the native may indulge in becoming a politician or a religious leader. With adverse aspects to natal Pluto, the thirst for control may be stronger than the desire to offer to humanity, and can create vicious attitudes towards others who are lower in hierarchy.\nMany times, disagreeing with such a native’s opinion and perception can be considered a mutiny, and he will fight to prove himself right. In addition, this placement can bring tendencies of revenge towards any person who proves himself more intelligent than the native, or elsehow questions the correctness of the native’s doctrines.\nPluto in the 9th house is also a very strong natal position for anything connected with the law. If the native chooses to study law, he is capable of learning and remembering every detail of the law system, making him an encyclopedia of rules and legislations. This placement can frequently create judges, because Pluto makes the native prefer to be on the top of control. Of course, Pluto located in the 9th brings along him strictness and seriousness in the house’s matters. Such a judge may follow the rules without any lenience or flexibility. Again, sticking to a doctrine is for him a way to express control; ninth house Pluto are actually receiving pleasure when other people are afraid of them. This placement also can prompt the native to create reforms in laws. He can become a wise scholar, responsible of restructuring the existent rules through thorough research, and make such a social transformation a life target.\nIn case you have your Pluto in your ninth house, you will probably adore the way he functions. It will grant you immense power over others, boosting your ego and self-confidence. You might reach life-changing personal discoveries, and generally reach high spiritual transformations. This placement is wonderful for you. Nevertheless, always care about not making it horrid for other people. Using such a blessing to create hell for others, will in the end make you lose everything you were granted. Do not forget that you are not above the laws of reality; your presence is also being tested and you will reap what you sow. Be good.

(1605, 0, 'us', 'pluto-in-8th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Pluto in the 8th house is definitely one of the most intense aspects a person can have in his natal chart. Pluto is domicile in this house ruled by Scorpio, residing on the throne of Sex, Death and Transformation. Is that a good thing, though? Well this largely depends on other details; yet for sure it will not pass unnoticed.\nThis natal placement gives a very high sex drive, making intimacy an obsession. Sex is for such people a death and rebirth experience, which will frequently include the simulation of the physical pain that surrounds the entrance and exit from the human life. With hard aspects falling from Saturn and Mars, the native will indulge in very violent sex, making sadism and masochism one of his many vices. These tendencies can be connected to some trauma, frequently of a sexual nature, that happened in the childhood. If something like that has not occurred, then there is a possibility that the individual suffered a very painful birth, which included a big risk of dying. In any case, the native has a very dark sexuality, indulging in breaking most taboos. A natural phenomenon is that his sexual energy attracts people with similar vices, which can even lead to sexual or physical abuse without consent. \n \n\n\nGenerally, this natal placement will make the person have various sexual fetishes, most of them hidden from the world’s eyes. In his relationships there will be a lot of power struggles, leading to symbolic games of domination in bed. With adverse aspects to Pluto a lot of jealousy and suspicion will arise; his significant other will frequently struggle from the native’s paranoid behaviors but such people tend to solve their relationship problems with even more sex. \n \n\n\nAs the 8th house indicates the financial status of the native’s marriage partner, Pluto will usually give a spouse who is obsessed by money. With good aspects to the planet the spouse might be very rich, while with bad ones he might experience a bankruptcy. In any case, the native has his partner as a source of income, frequently vampirizing on his money. There can exist a tendency of exchanging sexual energy with financial, without this needing to be in the frames of prostitution. The things are rather simple; the native gets turned on by powerful and rich people, while powerful and rich people get turned on by the native. And each offers the other one the object of desire.\nWhen such a deep and transformative relationship ends, Pluto will usually resist. He can turn passion into an urge for revenge, while if such a marriage ends up in a court the native will fight till the end. This procedure will be the swansong of the relationship, a final battle of who will prevail. Bad aspects to Pluto will bring a lot of fighting around money, which will also happen in case that the native inherits a legacy after someone’s death. Of course, if Pluto is well-aspected then things can be a lot calmer; in fact this will signify less resistance from the opponents and a rather easy victory of the native.\nPluto in his own house grants occult gifts, mostly of dark characteristics. Individuals who have their natal Pluto in the eighth house may develop clairvoyance and will be able to read minds of other people. A lot of their powers are enforced through the manipulation of sexual energy, and Pluto is acting as a bottomless black hole concerning the energy he can devour. Such people are capable of vampirizing on nearly every other person, as they are also usually very attractive sexually. They ooze of sexuality, even in cases that their physical beauty is not excelling. With an ill-aspected Pluto, the native might develop a lot of fears and nightmares; on the other hand such people adore darkness in arts, black color and seeming morbid in other people’s eyes. You could say that their fears and nightly dreams are a direct product of the parts that they fear in themselves.\nWhen Pluto is in the 8th house, the native is able to thoroughly see the details and uncover a lot of secrets. Such a placement is prominent for detectives, while also all types of researchers. It is very positive for anything connected with the microcosm, and if Pluto is somehow connected to the native’s occupation houses (6th or 10th) there are great abilities in jobs connected with nuclear physics and microbiology. In addition, as the 8th house rules banks and other similar institutions, the native might have a career dealing with loans and debts. In some extreme situations, Pluto here indicates engagement in money laundry, being an illegal loan provider or elsehow involved in criminal activities. These might even involve physical violence, blackmail or intimidation towards other people. \n \n\n\nWhen Pluto in the 8th has bad aspects, the native should be very careful with his own dealings with banks and moneylenders, as there can be a very high possibility of total bankruptcy. An ill-aspected Pluto can literally devour everything and create a total financial collapse. Of course, this will not be unjust; the native for sure will have passed his time eating other people’s money without caring of the consequences.\nIf you have your natal Pluto in the 8th house, be very careful with your attitude towards sex, money and the occult. Be sure that if you indulge in dark actions one day you will sow what you have reaped, and Pluto knows no borders. Restrict him, or else he will not have borders while taking back from you everything he gave.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:50:13'),
(1606, 0, 'us', 'pluto-in-7th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nPluto is widely known as the most intense planet, and when positioned in the house of partnerships he will definitely make the house matters be of a very dynamic nature. Natal Pluto in the 7th house indicates issues concerning control concerning the native’s partnerships; this is not necessarily bad though, as they will have tremendous transformative power on him and make him reborn under a new light.\nWith Pluto in the seventh, the marriage partner can have a rather obsessive and controlling character, with jealousy and suspicion being a common trait. Such a spouse is likely to be of a Scorpio/Pluto emphasis and possibly have his natal Pluto in the first house of his natal chart. When getting into a marriage partnership with such an individual, the native’s life transforms drastically, for better or for worse. Of course, the type of transformation is strongly connected to natal aspects of other planets to Pluto, and is heavily influenced by transits that occur.\nGenerally, keep in mind that people with such a placement treat all other individuals as a potential enemy and threat; they are highly suspicious themselves and will often attack for preventive reasons- this is their way of self defense. Their constant fear and insecurity in front of the others make them have an urge to establish themselves as an authority figure in their eyes; nevertheless the types of people they attract are of the same nature and will not just bow in front of them. So, they usually become the ones who are dominated, especially in their close relationships.\nThe usual pattern is that the spouse will have power over the native. Pluto in the 7th house gives a strong need of getting into deep relationships and the native is not satisfied with vanilla affairs. Often, the native will engage in theatrical or even dramatic situations and the marriage will be very demanding. Of course, this is a two-sided interaction and the one person mirrors the other. Natal Pluto in the 7th house implies that both sides try to exercise power on each other, and there can be a lot of actions containing feelings of revenge. Even small issues between the partners can generate retaliation, leading to a ping-pong of destructive actions. \n \n\n\nWith Pluto well-aspected, the marriage will permanently change both parts but in a good way. Such a placement, even if intense, will help them function well and dive deep into unification, helping them discovering relinquishment of their own personality and blending in a new whole, a couple that acts as one person. They will simply not be able to live without each other, and separating them will be harder than trying to break an atom to his compounds. This aspect might give a rather long relationship, which will only get challenged if some slow moving malefic planet forms a difficult transit aspect. Even then, the most likely thing is that the couple will overcome the difficulties and transcend to a new rebirth. \n \n\n\nOn the contrary, when Pluto has adverse aspects from malefics there can be extreme obsession from the partner’s side, which can even lead to verbal or physical abuse. Natives with Pluto forming conjunctions, squares or oppositions with Mars or Saturn should be very careful as their marriage can be destructive. Eventually, even this will transform them radically, but through very difficult experiences. Such type of difficult aspects will frequently bring divorces, nevertheless they are followed by lawsuits and the marriage partner will continue creating all types of problems even when the couple breaks up. He will definitely not be willing to give up and lose the native, as he may even consider him an object that he owns. \n \n\n\nThe 7th house is ruling one’s open enemies, and Pluto placed here indicates the presence of vicious ones. Be really careful if your Pluto is adversely aspected, as they can be of a very obscure nature and having really cruel traits. Of course, a native with such a placement is also pouring fuel in the fire of possible disputes, and the best remedy is to just keep away from people that have a very intense personality. The biggest problem is actually that the native enjoys such types of people and is drawn towards them. In any case, try to not create enemies as they might cause real problems in your life.\nThe same can apply for business partnerships. As the possible marriage partner, they are usually very domineering; choose wise before establishing a company with someone. This might be actually good to avoid, because if the business turns a bad decision then what follows will be catastrophic. Such a business partner will drag you to the court and will definitely become an enemy, trying to gain a victory against you and whatever he can financially. Of course, even such an experience will be permanently transformative, but why to indulge in it if you are beforehand conscious of such a possibility? \n \n\n\nIf you have such a natal aspect, you should understand that cooperation with the other person is the only way to reach a harmony. In such a situation, you can both reach new levels of consciousness and transform yourselves in the best way. Nevertheless, keep in mind that if you are the only one who struggles to find common ground for cooperation, your tries are rather doomed. If the partner is driven by unconscious Plutonian powers there is nothing you can do to convince him to act consciously. An ill-functioning Pluto in a natal chart of another means strong traumas, especially in the childhood years, that might even be impossible to heal unless working on them. Thus, if you have a hard 7th house Pluto, always check the Pluto condition of the other person. If it is adversely aspected, keep away. Do not worry, there are a lot of Plutonic people, you will find the right one to indulge in your power games; yet, in a safer type of relationship.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:50:18'),
(1607, 0, 'us', 'pluto-in-6th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nPeople who have their natal Pluto in their 6th house will have a very intense or even dark and hidden job. As Pluto is ruling Scorpio and the 8th house, all the jobs connected to death, sex, the unknown and taboos are career possibilities for such a native. What type of these rather uncanny jobs he will follow is mainly depending on other indicators, as planets aspecting natal Pluto or also present in the house, while also the house’s ruler and possible planets in the 10th house. Nevertheless, no matter what job he chooses, it will at least sound weird to the other people’s ears- and thus might even remain hidden. \n \n\n\nGenerally, 6th house Pluto people do not like to serve others and may have experienced childhood traumas with having to serve someone. They tend to abstain from volunteering of any kind, and put very strict borders in their duties and responsibilities at work. They are constantly observing their co-workers or customers, always ready to retaliate when someone tries to use them or elsehow mishandle them. If Pluto is adversely aspected, they are many times forced to work by their employers and the work atmosphere is rather bad. Even when the native’s natal Pluto is well-aspected, their job will have a lot of power struggles.\nPluto is ruling the microcosm and the things we do not see, so when he is located in the house of job he can create a molecular scientist, a person who works at a nuclear plant and a lot more jobs (mostly governmental positions) that are exploring the unknown borders of our reality. In addition, this placement will give the miner, the professional speleologist and the person who will be occupied in the salvage industry. The native can also be employed in other governmental services, usually of a secret nature.\nAs Pluto is the planet of death and transformation his presence in the 6th house can create the mortician, the undertaker, or even the person who creates sculptures for graves. All the jobs that are morbid and somehow connected with death are a part of this category. This connection might be even indirect; yet will be definitely present. The taboo atmosphere will manifest through whatever job it is, as there are possibilities that in the end the native’s job is chosen by a tenth house indicator and not the 6th. Thus, someone with such a natal Pluto could be employed at a mortuary in his youth, but when will manage to become a fiction writer and change a career he will still carry that obscure atmosphere in his writings. \n \n\n\nThis natal placement is also prominent in prostitutes. Be careful, this does not mean that whoever has a 6th house Pluto is into selling his body! This would happen mostly when Pluto is adversely aspected by Mars, Venus, Saturn or the lights, and has a lot more possibilities to happen if a T-square occurs between Pluto and two planets. A T-square is when a planet is squaring two planets, who at the same time are opposite between themselves. Usually, such natives are working under some other person’s guidance or even manipulation and pressure; high-end call girls are not the case. A person who has a 6th house Pluto experiences his job receptively and is submissive to his employer, and in case of difficult aspects with Mars and Saturn there can be a lot of cruelty or even physical abuse present. On the other hand, a positively aspected Pluto might bring a job as a simple cashier in a sex shop. Pluto of course tends to keep such jobs a secret, as the majority of people have taboos and prejudices. \n \n\n\nThe 6th house is the house ruling the native’s health, and a well aspected Pluto will grant to him strong recuperative powers and a great amount of physical strength. On the other hand, if Pluto is adversely aspected, the native should be very careful with his health. Pluto is ruling the reproductive system, and difficult aspects to him by Mars, Saturn or Uranus will bring a lot or problems, including sexually transmitted diseases. Mars is usually responsible for surgeries, while Uranus makes the health issue appear suddenly. In addition, another sensitive part concerning health is the colon area and the bladder, while he can also frequently suffer from hemorrhoids. The native should also beware of stray small animals that possibly carry diseases like rabies; ticks, spiders and snakes might pose a threat while also he should beware of not getting poisoned by deadly mushrooms.\nGenerally, the natives with Pluto residing in the 6th house should be very careful to not transfer the tensions of the work as health issues to their body. Such a native should battle stress as hard as he can, so that it does not manifest as a disease. The best remedy for Pluto issues is joy. If you have a natal Pluto in the 6th house, we know that this might be difficult.

The obsessions that Pluto creates can be permanent, and the catastrophes he can bring are definitely irreversible. Of course, this can bring a transformation towards something better, but are you sure that you want to lose every single piece of property just to start a new life from zero again? \n \n\n\nWhen someone has Pluto in the 5th house, his love affairs are very passionate, deep and intense. When he becomes obsessed with someone he will concentrate on this goal, and persistently push his life towards that direction. Usually, the native gets what he wants, but not without turbulences. It is the aspects upon Pluto, though, that define what happens after. Harsh squares and oppositions may indicate power games, jealoucy, dramatic relationships and very secretive situations. Not to mention that even when the native obtains what he wants, Pluto will be again hungry soon and will desperately need a new obsession. Such individuals will frequently have extra-marital affairs, which are usually full of passion but also quite destructive. If you have this natal placement and notice adverse aspects be careful; for when Pluto will unleash its dark and explosive powers during a challenging transit everything might be revealed and destroy the status quo. \n \n\n\nPluto present in the fifth house will give to a native a very intense and serious approach concerning having children. For them, parenthood is a very important responsibility, and their way of thinking will make them be very dominative towards their children. Such parents are constantly trying to intervene in their children’s life and dictate them what to do; this might be very pressuring to the child though, and make them develop a difficult character. If Pluto is adversely aspected by Mars or other malefics, the native might even physically abuse his children. This should be by all means prevented; if you see such aspects in your chart please consider to not making children. Pluto in this position can indicate a loss of a child. This is mostly metaphorical, as when the child comes of age he will abandon his parents if the Plutonic pressure they feel is overbearing. In case you have this placement and want to have a good relation to your offspring, consider finding ways of softening Pluto’s effects. Otherwise, the child’s departure will be inevitable and even permanent. \n \n\n\nNatives with the Pluto in the house of joy might be also obsessed with partying and having fun. This placement might become a black hole for a big part of their income, as they will eagerly spend a lot of money on going out, drinking and other recreational activities. Pluto desires to be fed and is never satisfied. The curious thing is that recreation is not taken light-heartedly by such people. It is a priority and needs to enclose quantity and quality- so if they do not have a good time this will manifest through nervousness or even anger.\nIn any case, if you have your Pluto in this natal position, be really careful about its manifestations; possible dark energies can affect other people, especially people you love. As Pluto is usually connected with a childhood trauma, there are possibilities that the native’s childhood came to an abrupt end earlier than it should, and he quickly entered the world of responsibilities. The best way is to heal your fifth house issues, through being open and playful. This way, the domineering planet Pluto will operate more gently. If you discover obsessive behaviors, try to deal with them by offering remedies or symbolical healing, and your 5th house life will illuminate. After all, Pluto has the wonderful transformative function of death and rebirth. If you see yourself malfunctioning in the 5th house matters, kill your mental approach towards them. You will be reborn with a new philosophy and way of perceiving those matters, and finally you will reach joy.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:50:28'),
(1609, 0, 'us', 'pluto-in-4th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nThe presence of Pluto in the house of one’s roots gives a very intense childhood and family. Of course, this is very much depending on Pluto’s condition and on the aspects he receives from other Planets. This is a rather difficult placement for the transformative planet, as it forces the chart holder become strong in his early years, to be able to confront the emotional challenges imposed.\nAs the 4th house is ruling one’s mother, Pluto makes her very domineering and controlling. She wants to interfere in the native’s life even when he is a grownup, and is constantly putting her nose in his activities. The native’s father might be also of such a nature; nevertheless it is the mother who strives for control. She usually has Scorpio traits, and can even be a dark character person. When Pluto has harsh aspects with Mars or some other malefic, the native may have suffered physical abuse from his parents during his childhood, while the overall home atmosphere can have been very toxic. In some cases, when natal Pluto is adversely aspecting the Sun or the Moon, the native can have lost one or both his parents early in life. This does not mean necessarily that the parent have died, but may also have left the family or otherwise not get involved in it. In any case, Pluto in the 4th house creates a childhood trauma in issues concerning his home and his family. \n \n\n\nPluto is the planet of secrecy, so when he is located in the 4th house he can shed a fog on the native’s past. He might feel a sense of guilt for his ancestors and will not speak a lot about them. His family becomes a private thing that he does not share with the public. The purpose behind such a behavior might be a subconscious need to forget the past, as remembrance can evoke hidden fears and scars that still live inside him. Even when Pluto has good aspects, he can bring a need to hide traces. The family and their story may need to be kept incognito as they might even be under some witness protection program. This placement is frequent in families that have fallen from power during a change of regime. \n \n\n\nIf Pluto is conjunct the 4th house cusp (also known as Nadir or Imum Coeli), the native will be obsessed not only with the roots of his family, but also with his country. This placement can make someone go deep into patriotism, while unhealthy aspects from other planets will turn him into a nationalist or some other radical ideology. If Pluto has squares, oppositions or conjunctions with Mars it creates the militarist. Such kind of people can become very dangerous if they manage to get into politics or receive an authority role. A difficult aspect with Uranus will also create a violent, unpredictable and destructive character. Such people can easily get involved in secret plots and love to bring havoc through riots, fire and destruction. All these paradigms are showing how the suppressed in childhood Plutonic energy can violently manifest during the adult years of the native. The connection is profane, and shows us how important it is to create healthy surroundings for a young child in order to bring up a healthy adult. \n \n\n\nThe presence of a benefic planet conjuncting Pluto is softening its powers. In this occasion, the parents might be strong as authority, but help him becoming independent early and show a good amount of love.\nAs the 4th house rules the person’s home, Pluto may force a person quit his property or even move to another country. This placement is frequent among political or war refugees. If Pluto has good aspects, the native and his family may receive big amounts of money from the sale of such a property, even if they have to become fugitives.\nIf you have such a natally placed Pluto, you should try to break its cycle. Forgive your parents and your ancestors, and do not become the same like them. This might be difficult, as these subconscious writings started while you were of rather small age and are buried deep in your subconscious as reactions. Nevertheless, by understanding the whole process and how your childhood can affect your behavior towards your own children, you can heal yourself and create a better surrounding for your offsprings. Dig deep in that darkness, embrace it and shade some light in what have scared you in the past. Do not allow yourself create the same shadows in the childhood of your own children.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 12:50:34'),
(1610, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-11th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWith natal Neptune in the 11th house, the native’s friendships are surrounded by the planet’s mist, making them either fantastic or deceptive. The sign in which Neptune is located, and especially the aspects of other planets play a very important role in defining if this natal placement is good or bad.\nIn any case, the individual with such a placement will attract quite a lot of people who will be of a rather weird nature. The 11th house is traditionally ruled by Aquarius and planet Uranus, and the presence of Neptune will bring friends who are mysterious and artistic. As Neptune rules substances, the native’s friends may frequently indulge in alcohol or drug abuse, which will make them rather unreliable and passive as characters. The native should be rather cautious, because such people may influence him a lot; hard aspects of Neptune to Mars or other malefics indicate that he may also enter their fake world of addictions. \n \n\n\nNeptune is dissolving the barriers of the house it is present in, so while in the eleventh it blurs the borders between the native and his friends. The groups in which he is a member may operate as a collective organism and the individual traits of each participant are dissoluting in the mass; this might be a wonderful experience of unification, of course provided that each person has good intentions. The danger is always present, as if some of the members have darker intentions they may manipulate the group and denounce any responsibility of their actions. They will cover it up under the collective responsibility, or even try to blame others (and the native too) for anything that can go wrong. \n \n\n\nIf you have this natal placement, be always sure that you build the right boundaries. In addition, as your perception might be idealizing your friends, have a family member or someone else who you trust for a long time tell you an opinion about the people you hang out. A different (and maybe even more conservative) point of view can save you from unwanted situations. Always be alert when your friends try to get much from you, and consider your life and belongings as something they can intervene or take as if it is normal. Guard against psychic vampires, their masks can be fascinating but it is what is under them that counts. Neptune in the 11th house tends to bring people that will abandon you when your finances decline, and this will definitely happen if natal Neptune is squaring some planet in the second house or its ruler.\nOn the other hand, the groups of people to which the native is attracted can be of a very spiritual nature, and when good aspects are present they will altogether indulge in activities that will expand their consciousness. Such groups might be of humanitarian purpose, promoting beneficial ideas and altruism.\nNatal Neptune in the eleventh house is great for being a part of musical or artistic organizations. The native will probably join at least one amateur artistic group, while it can  also indicate singing in choirs as Neptune rules spirituality and is connected with both singing and church. In any case, music and the fine arts will be definitely present in the gatherings of such groups – at least as a background of their functions if not as a central cause.\nAn adversely aspected Neptune will make the possibility of receiving help from friends while in difficulties highly doubtful. The most probable reaction would be that they will passively observe the native, and just show some compassion but not indulge in material or practical support. On the contrary, the individual himself might be always aiding his acquaintances, even if they seldom show signs of gratitude.\nThis natal placement can be a great blessing if used correctly, as it can lead to becoming part of pioneering hyper-organisms of people who unite. The native definitely strives create such a fantastic union, an utopian community where the individual souls blend and merge into a collective one. Nevertheless, he should always exercise wisdom concerning such matters. Even if such ideas will lead towards a better society, he must be sure that the rest group members share common visions. Thus, they should hang on their individuality as much as possible, and not allow a loss of personal Ego happen unless they are totally sure about it. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:14:09'),
(1611, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-10th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen an individual has Natal Neptune in the 10th hose, his career matters are strongly dependant on the planets condition. A well aspected Neptune will have an astonishing effect, while an adversely aspected can act as a totally passive malefic, which the native has absolutely no control over. \n \n\n\nNevertheless, the 10th house is a rather good placement for this dreamy yet erratic planet. It is far better to have it present here than in a house that directly affects the native’s life. After all, the traditional rulers of the 10th house (Capricorn and Saturn) are giving some of their serious traits to the otherwise borderless nature of Neptune. This restriction of the liquid Neptunian energy may be more easily channeled into some special career goal; provided of course that it is somehow connected with Neptunian jobs.\nTo become clearer, Neptune is not helpful for any job that has a concrete structure and needs organization. No matter how much hard the individual tries, he will not be able to put himself in a routine to do some serious business involving details. Thus, the preferable jobs are of an artistic or elsehow flexible nature, which allow freedom of movement. A reason behind of these patterns is frequently the character of the native’s most dominant parent. He was actually not dominant and misplaced himself as a parental figure, showing a lot of weakness towards the young native and confusing him about principles of discipline and authority. Also, one of the parents might have been absent or indulge in substance abuse; the individual does not observe someone working hard and successfully enough to develop a role model of how career should be structured. In some extreme cases, the individual’s parent may have serious mental illness and even be restricted- at least in his own fantasy world if not in a real institution.\nA person with natal Neptune in the 10th house will definitely not understand early in his life the direction he wants to follow. It usually takes quite a lot of time to clear out what he really loves to do, but from his early years he understands it is something rather unconventional. A very common pattern is that such people will tend to be involved in unstable jobs until their thirties, and curiously enough Neptune will produce rather a lot of temporary bartenders as he rules alcohol. With harder aspects, especially with malefic planets in the 12th, the person can be involved in substance selling- having of course quite a lot of risks of being caught and end up in restriction places. We firmly advise all people who have such an aspect to prefer doing a legal job instead of risking passing their young years in jail. \n \n\n\nExcept for artistic careers, the native can also make religion or spiritualism his life-path. A well aspected Neptune will definitely bring some Guru-type person in the native’s life, from whom he will learn a lot and later implement this knowledge into his work. Such types of natives are easily received in the embrace of church or other religious groups, but one should be very careful if his natal Neptune is ill-aspected. This could signify being guided by people with false pretenses, charlatans and swindlers.\nSuch a natal Neptune can also signify becoming a charlatan yourself, through using in a wrong way the occult or spiritual knowledge that you have developed. Generally, the secretive nature of Neptune may lead to wrong career paths such as this even if the native does not understand it. He might firmly believe that his services are of the best quality, while the truth may be that he is just vampirizing on his victims’ minds and pockets. This can be particularly observed when Neptune forms bad aspects with Mars or Mercury.\nAs Neptune is not only ruling the depths of the mind, but also the depths of the sea, an alternate career direction that could be very successful is everything connected with water. This could be fishing or working in a ship, oceanography, marine life protection and everything else similar.\nWhen Neptune is aspecting Venus, the native has exquisite abilities in performing the arts. His body is very sensitive to currents and vibrations, making him have the liquidity needed for becoming a wonderful dancer or actor. If also supported positively by the Sun or the Moon, there are very big possibilities of becoming famous through his art.\nGenerally, Neptune in the house of fame is throwing a veil of secrecy over these matters. This will create a lot of rumors, most of them not having any connection to reality. The nature of these rumors will highly depend on other planets involved in this aspect. Scandals and disgrace are not something uncommon, especially with an ill-aspected Neptune. The native should be aware that he is very vulnerable to such rumors, and even the positive ones might have a very strong influence on him. This is not necessarily good; a positive rumor might have an adverse effect in his productivity; he might indulge a lot in experiencing grandiose pride inside his mind instead of continuing to invest in his work. On the other hand, negative rumors will do the exact opposite, and the person may lose a lot of time by worrying and getting depressed because of them. \n \n\n\nGenerally, a tenth house Neptune person must always have someone more practical aid him with his work. A manager, a friend or a relative should be constantly throwing a look on what the native does, as he lacks the clear view of the big picture. They must take care that he is not used or under-paid, as he tends to undervalue his work and also lacks understanding of the financial ways that the system works. This ignorance can bring a loss of income, which end up in the pocket of someone else. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:14:14'),
(1612, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-9th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving your natal Neptune in the 9th house is one of the best placements for this planet, as it is much better for it to reside high in the heavens than below the horizon. Neptune placed here gives a man of tremendous faith in the divine, which may even lead him to make religion his way of life. \n \n\n\nAs the 9th house is traditionally ruled by Sagittarius and Jupiter, its expansive traits strengthen the mystic powers of Neptune, enhancing his otherwise passive functions. The 9th house pulls out the most positive characteristics of the blue planet, making the native interested in higher meanings. Such an individual will have the search for God and Truth a very important priority in his life.\nThis natal placement will give an interest in religions and mysticism, and usually lead the person to develop a rather different type of spirituality than the prevailing in his society. Neptune might therefore cast his mist around the native’s religious searches, making them of a rather secretive nature. If Neptune is positively afflicted, the native will experience a profound spiritual life. He will be a devoted believer to something higher, and will even have mysterious manifestations of events in his life that will provide him proof of the deity’s existence. \n \n\n\nThe native&#8217;s prayers will be heard and the heavens will aid him; he will attribute this help to the God he believes in, not understanding that he has the power to create reality himself. Neptune in the 9th house is a mirror in the sky; the native is addressing his prayers to his own mirror and they return as facts in reality. His faith will eventually move mountains, and many people with such an aspect will at least consider becoming monks or priests of the religion they follow.\nIn case that Neptune has hard aspects, especially by Mars, the native might become a victim of religious fraud. His wide open gates towards higher meanings can be used for intrusion towards his subconscious by a cult or some other type of religious organization. If you have an ill-aspected Neptune, be very careful of religious sects and always prefer to walk a lonely road in spirituality. You are rather sensitive and all type of spiritual swindlers will strive to vampirize on your mind; build some extra defenses towards “gurus”, especially those who are foreigners as the 9th house rules exotic and foreign lands.\nDo not join that brainwashing “Hare Krishna” group, no matter if they seem all happy and chanting. In case that you travel a lot abroad (and you probably will), observe the foreign religions as a cultural phenomenon and do not indulge in taking part in rituals or have a prolonged stay in a monastery or other secluded communities. Another possible danger is getting lost in a foreign country, as Neptune casts his fog in any house he is located in.\nConcerning higher education, Neptune might bring quite a lot of confusion. The native’s studies may be of a rather chaotic nature and his approach to them quite passive. Neptune helps viewing the broad concept of any subjects he learns, but definitely does not help concentrating on the details. If the native studies something that involves accuracy such as Mathematics, he might never be able to finish his university. On the other hand, this placement can make him excel in studies such as Sociology, Theology or anything else that is more philosophical and less practical.\nNeptune in the 9th house is a very powerful natal placement for writers, especially those of fantasy niches. The individual can directly access archetypes and information from the collective unconscious and use it in the fantasy literature that he develops, being thus able to touch deeper layers of the readers. If you have such a placement and are involved in writing, be very careful in your dealings with publishers; a badly aspected Neptune can signify attempts to steal your work or elsehow use you for profit.\nBe sure that you reserve your rights, and the best thing is to have some other dear person keep a track of all the legal actions you take to protect your work. Neptune may give you too much carelessness in your dealings with the system, and indicate losses of income due to wrong movements. It is a pity to write a wonderful book only to have his rights stolen or do something else stupid enough to diminish your gains. \n \n\n\nIf you have your natal Neptune in the ninth house, always remember that always relying on something higher is not a correct perception of reality. Yes, there exist higher things than us, but these are strongly interconnected with us; they are actually a part of us and even created by us. Thus, never be passive and waiting for miracles to fall from the heavens. You must always move your own hand to create the miracle; it will then eventually become reality.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:14:21');

(1613, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-7th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving your natal Neptune in the 7th house is a rather tricky position, as the planet will complex all matters concerning marriage, business partnerships and legal issues. This placement does not indicate tragic and harsh events, but rather a disillusionment and annoyance about everything ruled by this house. Neptune is the planet responsible for dissolution, so anything that includes strict boundaries is not favored.\nThe native with Neptune in the 7th house has idealized the concept of marriage, probably perceiving it as a permanent state of bliss with a significant other. This is usually not the case, as long lasting relationships can rarely keep that romantic magic of their first period. This nebulous approach towards love can bring quite a lot of frustration; the native may invest a lot of time in another person just to understand that all those years he was wearing pink glasses, not realizing who actually the other person is. Time cannot go backwards though, and the pattern gives a tendency to do the same mistakes again in next relationships or marriages. The internal need of finding someone who is ideal for unification will again appear, obscuring the real characteristics of the beloved one. \n \n\n\nUsually, the native will attract a spouse with heavy Pisces/Neptune emphasis; their marriage partner will be of an ethereal and careless nature, daydreaming a lot. In case that Neptune is well-aspected, the native will marry to an artist or someone who is very sensitive. If Neptune is adversely aspected by malefics then the spouse is likely to have substance addictions and barely perceiving reality; the marriage will often evolve in an unhealthy savior/victim relationship. The truth will be that the spouse will not want to be rescued- of course the native will have too an idealized perception to understand that his help is actually not having any influence. In addition, the native might experience a loss of income, either by spending on rehabs or for providing to his spouse the necessary booze or substances.\nMartian aspects to Neptune can bring a deceptive partner, hiding his real personality from the native. Unfortunately, the compassionate nature of the chart owner is willing to offer anything to their significant other, allowing the other to take advantage. The curious thing is that the native might not even have any idea that he is being used; even when friends or relatives try to wake him up he will prefer to continue his dreaming. \n \n\n\nWe should here notice that this placement does not affect the sexual life or the relationships that the 5th house brings. With such natal Neptune, the native should definitely consider sticking to 5th house loves and affairs, as they will be a lot more reliable and close to reality. He should understand that a total unification with another person will probably lead him to become his caretaker, a parental figure that will not be considered as a sexual one. Following the 7th house relationship might even lead to periods of celibacy, as the marriage can turn up to be a lot more platonic than the native can even imagine. Indeed, this is the pattern that especially appears when the partner is a substance abuser; he will prefer to indulge in his passions rather than invest in intimacy. \n \n\n\nBusiness partnerships are not functioning well, either. The partners are lacking the necessary seriousness, being irresponsible and careless. Their cloudy approach will definitely complicate the creation and sustenance of a healthy business company, they will frequently operate secretly and can even steal from the native. Generally, with this natal placement of Neptune the best is to not indulge into forming a collaborative business with someone, but rather to do something on your own or get employed.\nOne of the positive traits of Neptune in the 7th house is the weakening of one’s open enemies. These are lacking real power to harm him, and can just become a hassle. If the individual has a lawsuit with an enemy, this might last for years without a definite outcome except from annoyance. This placement can bring a lot of mistakes with paperwork and contracts, and these can be also a reason for legal disputes with others. Such lawsuits can even end without a clear victory for any side, and a loss of time and nerves for both.\nIf you have such a natal placement, thoroughly consider all the details before getting into some form of legal union. Whether it is marriage or business, you should dig deep in the details and be objective to yourself about who the other person is. It might be better to continue such a relationship without putting it on paper, as it will be a lot easier to back off if such a need appears.  And always remember: pity is never a good reason to get married. Playing the savior can be a dangerous game; if you really want to save someone then save yourself from your own decisions!\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be writte\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:16:55'),
(1614, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-6th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen Neptune is placed in the 6th house of a natal chart he indicates a troubled everyday reality. This placement is a difficult one, creating a rather careless person with many difficulties structuring his life. He should be very careful not to become prey of mischievous individuals that choose victims in order to use them.\nAs the 6th house is ruling employment, Neptune can bring periods when the native does not care about being employed or working in unstable jobs without a formal contract. Indeed, such a person might not be the best choice for any employer; a person with this natal placement is usually unreliable and daydreaming instead of working. The liquid nature of Neptune is not the best for organizing any 6th house affairs; he will always be rather chaotic in his work, frequently late and complacent. Neptune is strongly connected with water and is the traditional ruler of the 12th house; this makes him bring works connected to the sea and other water sources, while also to asylums, institutions, jails and hospitals. Of course, other job indicators should also support this passive planet to obtain such a job; otherwise the native will be aimlessly changing his career direction.\nIn case that the native has his own business and employees, these tend to be disloyal, frequently procrastinating and even stealing from him. In the best situation, when Neptune is not adversely aspected, they will be erratic and passive in their work. When the blue planet is challenged by malefics such as Mars though, they might be stealing from him, cheating concerning the quality of their work, lie about time they dedicate and generally try to use the native for their favor.\nAs Neptune is ruling substances, being positioned in the 6th house is rather dangerous for drug users. In case that Neptune has even one difficult aspect falling on him, the native should totally abstain from anything that makes his mind blurred. Also, he should be careful with handling all types of chemicals, as he might be rather careless and harm himself by poisoning. There is no other natal placement of Neptune giving such a big danger of being poisoned. Even when Neptune is located near the person’s Ascendant, it gives possibilities to be poisoned by others; but here in the sixth house mostly indicates personal accidents due to mishandling and a lack of care.\nNeptune in the 6th house may have effects on the person’s health. This placement can give mysterious diseases or bad doctors; it is a common phenomenon that when these people are sick the illness will hide itself from the eyes of the medic. In addition, the doctors can be swindlers and charlatans; thus if you have this natal placement you should wisely choose the person who treats you and checks you up. Even a good doctor can have his days off, and Neptune is likely to make him daydream while examining you. On the other hand, many of the health problems connected with Neptune are the ones that is difficult to fully understand or discover. Allergies, hypochondria and many autoimmune diseases without an apparent cause can manifest themselves during the person’s life. Most health disorders that this aspect brings are not life-threatening, but can be chronic and persistent, irritating the native’s nerves and being present in his everyday reality. This could be even something simple as a causeless constant itching and the need to scratch the skin. But, if this persists for months and years and becomes an everyday motive, it is likely that it will disturb the person a lot. \n \n\n\nIf you have your Neptune in the 6th house, you should be very careful about your natural tendency of researching alternative medicine and other ways of treatment. Neptune here gives big possibilities of being swindled by self-called gurus, tricked with expensive natural herbs and extracts that actually do not help you and generally be used by professionals who search for victims in easy believers. Also, you should never self-diagnose your health affairs, and no; do not shop those special pills from Bangladesh that you saw on Google. If they are just ineffective, maybe losing some money is not a problem for you; but what if they are dangerous for your health because they have not passed any approval through research of their effects? \n \n\n\nThe best advice for someone who has this natal placement is to organize his daily affairs by making lists. There is a definite need of structuring his reality, as the Neptunian energy is too flexible and foggy. What is needed is some steady rules to support his everyday actions and responsibilities, otherwise his life will be a constant havoc that only another person would be able to change. Indeed, even this is an option; nevertheless this implies a total surrender to the other individual and the transfer of control to him, which is not the best option always. \n \n\n\nNeptune in the house responsible about serving others will usually give a passive role to the native. This is an internal need, as the native’s character is of a very compassive nature. This is something difficult to change, but can be handled if the individual learns to say no and put borders between him and the world around him. Serving others is not a bad thing; nevertheless one must be wise to choose whom he will serve and not just allow everyone take advantage. In case that this happens, we are talking about some kind of a spiritual prostitution, where anyone is allowed to use the native. Of course, this can be seen only when Neptune is really badly aspected, usually by 3 or even more planets. This condition though, may also indicate mental disorders of some kind. \n \n\n\nWhen Neptune is only well-aspected, it can indicate a spiritual healer. He is meant to heal other people, and this can become a life goal. There is a possibility that such a person will not care about anything else, and will dedicate himself to serve the humanity selflessly. Of course, such a life can be very hard; there will be a relinquishment of most other things and priorities. In case that someone is on the verge of choosing such a way, he should reconsider all the options, and definitely stay out of sects and spiritual groups.

(1615, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-5th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen Neptune resides in the 5th house, its effects on the love life, children and recreation habits of the native are quite foggy. The planet may create a lot of secrecy in the house’s matters; on the other hand there are possibilities of receiving immense joy. Even if it is induced through fantasies and delusions, and does not represent reality.\nBefore speaking about the possible traits this mysterious planet can create, we should notice that the aspects from other planets to it are playing a very important role. Neptune is a mirror covered in fog, reflecting a very big amount of the energies it receives from other planets. Thus, a Neptune with positive aspects from planets can be functioning perfectly and resonating all the good traits of the aspecting planets. On the other hand, the difficult aspects can make Neptune function as a malefic; and even worse- a passive and receptive one. \n \n\n\nThe 5th house is known to be the house of joy and recreation, and the presence of Neptune creates an individual who knows how to appreciate art. Neptune will make the native love dancing, and in the horoscope of a woman will make her movements be rather seductive and slow. One would literally observe the water waves flowing through such a person, because their body can melt in the rhythm of the music. There can also be a talent in poetry, while with other aspects present they can develop abilities in musical instruments. \n \n\n\nAs the fifth house is ruling one’s children, the presence of Neptune will give to the native’s first child the character of a dreamer. Its mind will be constantly roaming in fantasies, and can be very careless, even passive towards their own lives.  The child is very gifted and creative and has tendencies to become an artist. It is emotional and sensitive, while also can develop psychic abilities and be highly intuitive.\nWhen Neptune covers with his fog the fifth house of a person, he can create secrecy around the native’s children. If he is a man, he may have a child and never even know it, while if a woman things can get even more complicated. She could be unsure about who is the father, or the biological father could be different than her spouse. This aspect might also signify artificial insemination from an unknown donor. In addition, if Neptune is adversely aspected by Mars, Uranus or some other malefic then there are possibilities of miscarriage or abortions. If you have such kind of aspects, you are strongly advised to not indulge in substances usage, as they might both bring an unwanted pregnancy and terminate even a one wanted. In addition, this aspect might even signify adopting a child.\nPeople with such an aspect can have more than one sexual partner during the same period. Their love life can be consciously very liberal or even totally careless. Neptune in the fifth house creates a lot of secrets concerning the native’s sexual affairs. Nevertheless, the native is not a sexual predator. The gentle nature of Neptune is bringing a lot of romanticism in his affairs too; it is just that Neptune’s fog does not allow certain borders define his relationships. This is the reason why it is easy for people with such an aspect to date many people simultaneously; each affair is a different beautiful story, and they perceive all of them as if they are a different person in each one.\nWith adverse aspects, Neptune in the 5th house may be victimized. The native will frequently fall in love for the wrong person and be torn down, while keeping idealizing that person long time after. The blue planet gives characteristics of martyrdom and masochism; the native is willing to suffer and even accept anything from the person he is in love with. Also, this natal placement can give victim/savior relationships, sometimes with a rather dramatic and dreamy atmosphere that reminds of movies. They tend to attract chaotic and unusual partners, and with them comes general confusion in most matters of the house. If you have this aspect, be careful to not fall in love with someone’s faults, instead of his virtues. Such an aspect may easily make you attracted to alcoholics and junkies, people who have problems concerning their sexuality and physically crippled. Again, the victim/savior pattern can be triggered and arise a need to nurture. \n \n\n\nWhen someone has Neptune placed in the 5th house, he should frequently take off those pink-colored glasses that filter the perception of the world and his love life, even if he later will wear them again. Indeed, many times such a perception can make someone very happy and empower the house’s affairs. But a stable basis is necessary, and he should constantly observe reality; otherwise, he would just keep idealizing whatever comes forth in his road.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:17:12'),
(1616, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-4th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen the mysterious planet Neptune sheds his shades on the house of one’s origins, his childhood and roots can be rather blurred even in his own mind. Growing up is not easy with this aspect, and a curious fact is that the native will usually bury his childhood deep into his subconscious while growing up. It will literally seem to him as a life of some other person he once watched in the movies, and remembers just fragments and scenes.\nThis placement can be rather difficult for the native’s early years, as it makes at least one parent absent, metaphorically or even literally. In many occasions, the native will be of a child of a divorced family. Many people who are growing in an orphanage or have elsehow lost their parents have this aspect. There is general confusion in the child’s mind about his origin, because even if his parents are physically present in his life, they actually do not act as parental figures. Neptune rules alcohol and substances, and with difficult aspects from Mars or Pluto can make one or both parents addicts or drunkards. This aspect can even make the real identity of on e of the native’s parent hidden, and it can be revealed to him later in his life. Usually, the native does not keep a lot of contacts with his ancestors when he becomes an adult.\nOn the other hand, when Neptune has only positive aspects, then the parents are dreamers, do not impose themselves as authority figures in the person’s life and are regarded by him mostly as people who just surround him. He feels as if he is born and growing by himself. The child observes the passive character their parents have, and categorizes them as beings of lower power than him. For such a person, living by the sea or somewhere near water generally can be a life goal. Such types of residences calm them down and might become a priority, especially in the latter years of their lives.\nNatal Neptune in the first house gives very passive parents, especially the mother. She can be literally living in a fantasy world, or even be a religious fanatic. With very hard aspects falling on Neptune, she can be in some kind of religious sect, manipulated in such a way that she does not even contribute her time in raising her child. Nevertheless, the native has the tendency to idealize her and forgive all the lack of attention. He perceives his parent(s) as people who suffer, martyrs carrying their crosses or being scapegoats, and cannot really blame them. In fact, this placement can even create a lot of compassion to the passive parent, and forms the native’s character for the rest of his life. He will frequently help other people who get victimized, or have similar problems to his parent.\nPeople with such a natal Neptune should be very careful with property issues, as they can experience some kind of fraud in their lives. If you have adverse aspects between Neptune and/or Mercury, be extra careful with everything that has to deal with real estate. There can be frequent moving to different houses and change of residence, while some of them could even be in hidden locations. \n \n\n\nThis placement can differ a lot, depending on the aspects of the other planets to Neptune. Neptune is a receptive planet, passively transforming the energy it receives from natal aspects or transits. Thus, a positively aspected Neptune will radically differ from an adversely one. Also, do not forget that the planet is a generational one, moving very slowly through the signs. A possible hard aspect from another generational planet is something that all people born in the same period will have. I personally consider harsh aspects with Mars,  Mercury, the Sun or even the benefic planet of Venus more difficult as they are more personal and directly affect the psyche of the individual. \n \n\n\nDue to the fact that Neptune is connected with the collective subconscious and unconscious, its placement in the fourth house of an individual can gift him with inheritance of occult powers, which will be rather uncontrolled. The planet rules magic and illusion, and can create a lot of strange facts both around the native’s family and his childhood. The energies that manifest are beyond his control, and unless he has some strong planets in the 8th he will not be able to tame them.\nIf you have such a placement, you should be very careful in providing your home as an asylum for people with problems. Neptune in the 4th house will easily accept his drunkard or junkie friend to live with him, in order to save him from homelessness. Even though this can be a beautiful movement with good intentions, the friend might actually start using the native as a stable basis for continuing his substance-centered life. In such a way he might become a burden for many years, and even using the native as a source of income for his addictions. Friendship is a wonderful thing; be sure though that it is both-sided. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:17:20'),
(1617, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-3rd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nThe misty planet Neptune brings a lot of fog to all issues ruled by the house it is natally. When located in the third house it mostly affects the native’s communications, siblings, neighbors and nearby travels.\nThis placement tends to scatter the mind and make it chaotic; the person should keep away from occupations that have to deal with numbers as it is irresponsible to handle information that has very important details. On the contrary, the mind becomes very intuitive and can excel in more abstract areas. The native must be very careful in filling important papers, as his mind will frequently forget to fill all the necessary data or do crucial mistakes because of lack of concentration.\nNeptune in the third house is strongly connected with writing and creating art; his presence in the third house can grant poetic abilities or lead someone to become a painter or a sculptor. If Neptune is aspected by Venus, then these abilities are a life path that will surely be followed, and the person will also dance beautifully. As characters, they are calm and people tend to like them. Third house Neptunians do not quarrel and people tend to show a lot of sympathy towards them. They are mostly considered as calm, cute and sometimes even boring, as they seem lost in their own world.\nNeptune can confuse relations with siblings. It gives possibilities of having step-brothers and step-sisters, while also having siblings far away or not knowing them. As the third house rules neighbors, the borders with them can become quite flexible and make them behave like siblings. At least one sibling might be of an artistic type, while if there are hard aspects to natal Neptune the sibling might have problems with substance abuse or alcoholism.\nThe third house is responsible about aliases and nicknames; the native can be rarely using his real name and instead preferring some nickname. This is even more frequent when he has some artistic inclinations; he then usually creates an alter ego, a fictional name persona under which he prefers to present his works to the masses. \n \n\n\nThis position of Neptune is great for entering Astrology studies. The native can easily perceive the mechanism under the movements of the stars and understand the big picture, while the planet’s sponge-like behavior can devour great amounts of information about planetary positions and aspects. This can build a big database of information in his mind, and so his astrological readings will have a lot of success both because of the amount of knowledge stored and of his natural sensitive receptors that promote mediumship and foreseeing.\nThe third house is ruling daily routines, and Neptune has the magic ability to make them unstable and chaotic. The individual will frequently be late at his appointments, or even forget about them at all. There is lack of discipline and organization in everyday tasks, which when the native is young and still at school can lead into challenges in learning. He is frequently daydreaming during the time he has to study, and from little age will show a preference in reading fairytales and other books that will evolve his fantasy and imagination. He prefers to absorb information through intuition; the regular ways of education seem quite boring – the native thinks in images, sounds and feelings rather than in written words. \n \n\n\nShort journeys are ruled by the third house, and Neptune’s presence gives a lot of short travel by sea or resting at the beach. People with this natal aspect will prefer places with water in general; rivers, waterfalls, lakes and so on. Such places give them the peace of mind they need – they are the perfect spots for meditating and thinking their next steps in life.\nIndividuals with this placement are frequently collectors of things, and keep this hobby even when they grow up. If Neptune is in a debilitative position, the hobby can evolve to a mania that will steal a lot of his free time, or even time that should be dedicated to important things. The person will just love going to flea-markets or special shops, to discover more collectibles of the kind that he searches. Big amounts of money can be spent on on-line shops too. He can become a fetishist towards these objects, feeling them as having a real soul. They are easily hypnotized, especially with the help of moving objects, and can easily become followers of religions or sects, as they usually easily accept spirituality ideas imposed on them.\nA good piece of advice is to always have a more stable person near you, whether it is while learning in school, studying or working. Someone who brings you back to earth while you are distracted, someone who will inspire you to keep yourself organized or even organizes you himself. The good thing is that there will be always such kind of people present, a third house Neptune brings a lot of kind people around you- you just have to choose the best ones, reach out your hand and bring you near them. A third house Neptune is always receiving help – except if he keeps to shy to ask for it and no one notices! \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:17:32'),
(1618, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-2nd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNeptune is probably the most passive planet, and having him in the house of wealth and possessions is definitely not the best placement for finances. Nevertheless, that might not have an adverse effect on the life of the native, as it is very frequent that people with Neptune placed there do not care about material gains.\nPeople with Neptune in the second house are very impractical in everything that concerns money. They do not pay attention on their expenses, and definitely do not have their financial life programming as a priority in their daily routine. Even if they are wealthy, they just don’t care what is happening in their wallet and how their assets are being spent. They can be easily swindled, especially if Neptune is forming a tough aspect with Mars or/and Mercury. Second house Neptune people must also be very careful to not become financially vampirized by religious cults and spiritual charlatans.\nBooks, theatre, music concerts and other forms of art and entertainment are often one of their biggest expenses; Neptune desires to be fed through the second house and this can be rather expensive, as he likes luxury and prestige connected with the fine arts. The native might prefer to pay his last money of the month to go to concerts than keep them for his basic needs. Such behaviors can lead to bankruptcy, even though that might not be a tragedy every time when happens, as the person usually does not have a lot to lose, and always begin from the scratch. \n \n\n\nIn extreme circumstances, the native can vow poverty, for his own religious, cultural or political beliefs. When such a Neptune forms a trine with the Sun, the Moon, or other fame-bringing planet that are located in the 10th house, he can become a social paradigm, a well known person for his conscious stance towards relinquishment of material goods.  Another issue that can appear when Neptune resides in the second house is under-valuation of one’s work and charging for it lot less than the work is indeed worth.\nOn the other hand, through such kind of artistic pursuits the character of the person becomes highly spiritual and he evolves in a very natural way as a personality. His whole existence is illuminated from this finer response to vibrations that he receives. His spirit might be a lot more clear than the rest of the world, as emotions are a lot more valuable for him He might easily become a being that spreads unconditional love, ignoring all forms of materialism that tend to divide people. That attitude might turn out good for them, as they might live very happily. Frequently, such kind of people will end up being parts of auto-organized communes where money has no place, and even if they do not choose a stable life in such groups they will definitely choose such camps as destinations for their vacation. Their simple way of life might  even lead them to become self-sustain by creating a farm to produce the necessary food.\nIn some situations, when Mars is conjuncting Neptune or a malefic from the 12th house creates a square with him, the person might gain money through selling drugs. If you do it, stop doing it: a malefic in the 12th house can even signify imprisonment. Very frequently, this placement of the misty planet can give artistic jobs; they are not bringing a lot of money unless Jupiter or another benefic is positively aspecting Neptune but can bring a lot of satisfaction. It can frequently give singers and musicians, but usually the unstable type that plays once in a while in bars or even on the streets. \n \n\n\nBefore getting involved in any type of business, they should always consult someone who has a better vision about finances. Neptune does not allow catching the full picture of the project in the correct way, and solely depending on the native’s intuition can go pretty wrong. They should have an external observer who realistically reassesses the chances of success, in order to not fail in a project that otherwise would have a lot of possibilities to succeed. Also, issues like retirement, pension and savings should be thoroughly planned, as many times this Neptune placement brings procrastination and laziness in such issues, with unwanted results in the end.\nA job that can bring quite a good income for such natives is selling antiques and paintings; if Neptune is positively aspected it might even bring huge amounts of money but mostly in unexpected ways. Neptune here does not guarantee a steady income, the same way that the Moon does not. This feminine giant planet has its own mysterious ways of gifting its presents, which do not follow the stable rules of cause and effect. \n \n\n\nIn the end, any financial advice that we would give, would probably have no effect on the person that has this natal aspect. Simply because this whole area of his life is being perceived through different lenses, of a higher octave.  Should we maybe observe them, and learn from them?\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:17:37'),
(1619, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-1st-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen Neptune is located in the first house of a native, his ethereal nature opens the gates of the other realms, making the person very sensitive to everything around him. He uses osmosis for perceiving reality and is a very strong receptor, an antenna that can receive literally everything that is near his personal sphere (or even not near). This is a double-edged knife as it can give enormous abilities but also weakens his defense towards negative influences from his surroundings.\nAn important advice before we continue about the traits the mysterious planet can gift: People with such a placement should be very careful with drugs, alcohol and any substance that can furthermore blur his already liquid reality. Neptune himself is creating a personality that is stepping with only one leg to the ground, so misuse of substances might totally disconnect someone from the common reality. If Neptune is only positively aspected and shielded by strong planets, then experimenting will not harm the native but rather enhance his ability of understanding the thin web of how the universe functions. Nevertheless, any usage should be under control and he should never allow himself get hooked on any kind of dependant substance. Individuals that have adverse aspects from Mars, Pluto, Saturn and Uranus should not even try to experiment. They are very prone to substance abuse, and such kind of behaviors might awaken/create mental illnesses and psychological problems.\nA main characteristic that Neptune in the first house gives are magnetic and mysterious eyes. They are so different than most other eyes, that it is frequently easy to tell who has this placement. They look out-worldly, piercing and secretive; people with such a placement are of the most difficult to be read through their eyes. You cannot understand when they are lying, and they do not betray what their mind is thinking that moment. Usually, they are green blue or grey, and they give a feeling as if the person is not looking you in your eyes but rather focusing some centimeters behind them.\nSuch kind of people can have great abilities of hypnosis, their penetrative look can easily mesmerize. This ability is enhanced when Neptune is supported by trines or sextiles from Jupiter, Pluto, the Sun or the Moon. The light of each of these planets is reflected by Neptune and projected to the outer world, granting even more power in their gaze. Neptune acts as a mystical mirror; other people can easily perceive him as having any of these planets in the first house. Neptune is the planet of masquerade. No one can understand who exactly the person with Neptune in the 1st house is. Even more, the other people project themselves in the mirroring presence of such a native, and tend to believe that he has the same characteristics as themselves. You probably have read the book “The Perfume” of Patrick Sueskind, or seen the movie that was based on it. A paragraph about the protagonist can give you the exact vision of how Neptune functions when in the first house.\n“&#8221;Everyone considered the man in the blue jacket \n \n\n\nas the most beautiful human being they have ever seen: \n \n\n\nnuns saw on him the Messiah in flesh;\nSatan&#8217;s adorers the lustrous Prince of Darkness;\nphilosophers the Supreme Being;\nyoung females an enchanted prince;\nMen an ideal reflection of themselves.&#8221;\nNeptune is by no means the most stable planet. Having him in the house of Self, can blur one’s goals. Such a native might not have concrete aims for his life, thus acting unreliably and prefer roaming around without a reason or a structured plan. This does not mean he does not enjoy it; it can create a very happy bohemian, a bon viveur, a flaneur of life. His life might be extremely interesting and full, yet without the stability that other people prefer to have around them. They usually watch vivid dreams, many of which are prophetic. A lot of them can develop abilities of clairvoyance, though with Neptune placed there these abilities might not be easily controlled and tamed. The planet is too misty to be fully understood, even astrologers have a hard time understanding his effects in a natal chart. Their childhood was floating in fantasies and they usually build their own fantastic world around them. If they have good writing abilities through other planets positions in their chart, they can become amazing fantasy/science/mystery fiction writers. \n \n\n\nSuch people are often confused themselves about their identity. They constantly daydream, can live inside book/series characters and even copy a lot of their characteristics. They have hard time establishing a self-definition; they actually do not care about it. Being fluid is something they like, and there are frequent changes in their personality. They are sponges with endless capacity, so their character is constantly evolving to something different. They will have a lot of spiritual experiences in their life, and many unexplained things will happen to them. As their gates of perception are more open than the rest people, they attract supernatural phenomenas.\nIndividuals with this placement should also be careful to not be hypnotized by mischievous people who can use them. As we already mentioned, their widely opened gates have less defense towards external influences. Also, they should as much possible diminish the feelings of guilt; they tend to take on their back the guilt for anything bad happening in the world. In addition, they have a tendency of trying to become saviors, or even martyrs for the others. If they keep low on these traits, they can save themselves from many trouble, as it will be a lot more difficult for other people to use them. Altruism is great, but one must also always take care about himself instead of only the others. This way, he will indeed be able to help and serve others in a correct way.\nWhen a first house Neptune has other people around him, he can easily understand their feelings. When entering a café, he can feel the thoughts of the people, so it is necessary to keep away from places with negative energy or psychic vampires. Once every three or four days, it is wise to pass a day away from masses of people, to regenerate the personal energy and get cleaned from others’ psychic influences. This will help the person to also self-determine his existence, because when he is frequently surrounded by masses his subconscious is overly-copying characteristics and patterns that are not his own.\nMusic is extremely important, as long as anything artistic. Neptune in the first house does not grant some artistic ability by himself; he creates the appreciator of other’s art. People with such a placement can become great art critics. \n \n\n\nTheir body needs more sleep than most other people; they tend to be weak of physical strength even if they have an athletic figure. In physical battles, they have the tendency to surrender or run, unless some strong planet like Mars or Pluto supports the passive Neptune. In addition, they are more prominent than others to develop confusing and rare chronic illnesses, or to discover an illness that they already have.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:17:42'),
(1620, 0, 'us', 'neptune-in-12th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen Neptune is in the 12th house of a natal chart, he feels at home. The 12th house is the archetypal house of Pisces, and Neptune who is their ruler can only function well when is in his own domain. Even adverse aspects that might be falling upon him have their own meaning of existence, and this is awakening him through lessons and allowing him shine his Neptunian light into the depths of the natives subconscious and unconscious.\nThe 12th house is the house responsible for all the things that are laying beyond the native’s conscious mind, and the ethereal presence of Neptune awakens abilities that are connected with his own deeper layers, but also the collective unconscious of the mankind. This placement can make someone a great psychologist, even if he does not follow this as a career. For a career in psychology, more indicators are needed, connected with the tenth or sixth house. Otherwise, the abilities will remain in his personal life, making the native the compassionate friend that will be always there for other people, ready to solve their internal dilemmas and problems.\nNeptune in the 12th house goes beyond the realms of reality as we observe it. A person with such a placement can develop clairvoyance and other psychic abilities, his dreams might be prophetic or include symbolisms that can be later decoded. The reason for that is that his gates are open to the world of archetypes and symbols more than anyone else’s, but an adverse effect is that when a gate is open, things from the other side can enter back. This, combined with the passiveness that Neptune tends to give, can make them very sensitive, and their ability to absorb everything through osmosis can make them a shell attracting the sufferings of others. Their natural empathy makes them easily receive the thoughts of other people and the general atmosphere of the environment, having even effects on their own body. Of course, when instincts and conscious thought reaches high development, such kind of people start avoiding whatever is negative, and manage to protect themselves from their surroundings. \n \n\n\nThe 12th house is also responsible for institutions, thus giving great possibility for either working in one, or being a part of one. Again, the whole chart must be examined to see what of the two (or none) will happen. Being in an institution does not necessarily mean imprisonment by force, and only those with very destructive aspects would reach an asylum. There is more high probability of a conscious entrance, and as Pisces and Neptune are closely tied up with spirituality and religion, one with such a placement could either try some kind of monachism or hermetism, or just pass periods of being a loner, walking his personal path of understanding his own depths. \n \n\n\nSomething that a 12th house Neptunian should always be careful, is feelings of guilt that can appear without apparent reason. Their inclination to help all the people around them will probably fail to become a reality, as there is neither time nor a way to aid everyone. Whenever someone around them experiences a personal catastrophe, the native tends to feel blamed by himself, which is negatively affecting his everyday reality. The lesson to be always remembered is that by allowing guilt creep in his mind, he actually turns towards being the person who is in need of help, instead of being a person who can help others. If one genuinely wants to assist others, he must first learn to stand firm in his own existence. A doctor must be cold-blooded, if he wants his job done well. This is the best form of compassion that he can show.\nAnother issue that such a native should be careful of, is addictions to substances. In case that there exist squares or oppositions with Mars, or even the benefics Jupiter and Venus, he has tendencies to overindulge in whatever alters his reality. Neptune chooses such kind of roads to feed himself, without caring what this can create to the body. We should not forget that our physical shell is ruled by the Ascendant, and if the presence of Neptune is too close to it, the effects of substances can be even harsher. \n \n\n\nThis placement is also wonderful for all people that are involved in all kind of art; they are capable of receiving the waves and trends flowing in the collective dreams. The images that they catch with their super-sensitive antennas can create massive déjà-vu when presented to the audience, giving them a very quick rise in their career. Also, in case that other planets strengthen this position, one can handle mass hypnosis phenomena. This does not have to do with hypnotism as a psychiatric technique; the native could simply be a music composer whose music can be so catchy as a vibration that large masses receive it as an “earworm” reproducing it unconsciously even a lot of times during a day.\nWhoever has Neptune in the 12th house, should find ways of building protective barriers towards all that what is outside them. The reason is simple: too many information. When a barrier does not exist, the data and the collective feelings keep streaming to his conscious mind without something to stop them, leading to a tiring reality where no privacy of thought is present. The best way, of course, is constructive. Whether this will be dedication to an art or to some other hobby, the native must find a pattern that will channel this flow towards a certain direction. When the channel is built, it is easier to create protective taps for the flow. \n \n\n\nCurrently, Neptune is slowly transiting through Pisces and will be swimming inside his own home until 2025. This will be a strong generational phenomenon, as all the children born during these years will have very strong Neptunian characteristics. If we also consider that roughly one out of twelve will be having Pisces Neptune placed in the 12 house, we are probably see these children to become the most spiritual generation of the last centuries. Perhaps a different, better world awaits us, where collective traumas are healed and peace is a vital goal of humanity.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:17:48');

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet. \n \n\n\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart. This topographical extreme point of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 12th can be one of the most dangerous natal placements she can have. AS the 12th house is directly connected with the native’s subconscious and even unconscious, she can induce a lot of fears. The house is ruling one’s sleeping routines, and Lilith can bring a lot of nightmares. The dreams will frequently have mystical atmosphere, and sometimes connected with sexuality. As Lilith is responsible of the darkest forms of sexuality, her influence may bring dreams of rape and unwanted perversions.\nThe 12th house is the traditional home of Neptune and Pisces, and when Lilith blends with them she can invoke their obscure sides. Especially when she is ill-aspected, Lilith can bring addictions to alcohol, drugs, and even prescription medicines. The reason is simple; her presence in the subconscious parts of the mind might make the chart owners deeper thoughts unbearable. When she is activated, she may radiate vicious thoughts and general negativity towards the individual’s mind. And we are not talking only about depression; Lilith tends to bring harsher sentiments as self-wrath, self-destruction and other negative feelings. Thus, substances can become to the native the easy way of escaping from his own mind. If you have this placement, watch out for difficult aspects with Mars, Pluto or Saturn. In case you have them, stop using any type of substances and try out alternative ways of escapism. In addition, Neptune adversely aspected to Lilith can also act as a strong malefic. In such a situation, the individual may never even understand the problematic situations that Lilith can bring, because his mind is creating a world of illusion, far from reality. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, Lilith in the 12th house gives a small blessing. People with this placement despise being alone. They do not like restriction in a small place or circle of people, and this will make them be rather popular and outgoing. When they are around a lot of people, they stop concentrating on their own fears. This can even be an automated psycho-therapy, that the native indirectly does to himself. Of course, the Lilith influences still remain hidden under the carpet when we do not take care to heal them, and will reoccur once the chart owner again remains on his own. \n \n\n\nAnother positive thing that this placement can bring, is that the native does not like to suffer and become a martyr. He might be too egoistic to self-sacrifice for other people, yet this can also save him from situations that can bring pain- both physical and emotional. In addition, such a person will not enjoy anything connected with the twelfth house. So, places and institutions of seclusion will bring to the chart owner feelings of repulsion. He may hate hospitals, prisons and monasteries, while also any possibility of living in such surroundings. Also such a person will hate the idea of having secret enemies. This might be a tricky part though, as Lilith can certainly bring some. Yet, the biggest problem might be obsessive thought about possible enemies, and phobias that the mind will create itself. As the 12th house is the gate to our previous lifetime, Lilith placed there may bring karmic enemies from past incarnations. That is why the native will be born with an inherited repulsion towards enemies, and will constantly be suspicious about them. Of course, as Lilith does not enjoy 12th house matters, she will push the chart owner as far as she can from such situations.\nLilith in the 12th house is fond of secrets, many times dangerous ones. Such an individual may know critical information about others, or hide very dark secrets of his own. Again, there is high chance that those are of a sexual nature. Other types might be connected with physical abuse, traumas or other taboo matters. Another thing that Lilith can do is swipe traumas under the carpet of one’s subconscious. Such a person can literally forget a traumatic experience, especially if it happened in the childhood. Yet, it is always there, deep, ready to hurt. Even his nightmares can be connected with the suppression of such events. The subconscious itself is trying to speak out, to tell to the organism that a problem exists and is buried in the core levels of the chart owner’s psyche.\nSuch a natal placement can give very strong occult powers. It will be even more potent in case that Lilith is located in a water sign, or conjunct a planet. In case you have such aspects, be very careful about the occult roads you may follow. Learn how to tame that darkness that is hidden behind the curtains of your conscious, or else you might be tempted into creating malice through magick. \n \n\n\nThe best way of softening the difficult traits of Lilith is symbolically indulging in 12th house matters where the ego dissolves and is recomposed in a different character.  Face your fears, and even try psycho-analysis if the traumas are deep. In case that no traumatic events occurred in your childhood, then it will be a lot easier to even use those powers for your own benefit. AS the 12th house is the toughest one to handle, you should be very careful of how you reprogram yourself. Try a harmonic approach to those matters. Learn your mind, and choose a slow procedure of uncovering what is hidden inside. Do not be afraid if you find things, memories or events that will shock you. Embrace them and make them your power. This will be the way to create light from your darkness.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:18:07'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way. \n \n\n\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart. This topographical extreme point of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side. The placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative. \n \n\n\nHaving Lilith in the 11th can complicate an individual’s group activities, making it uneasy to express when among a lot of people. It may be connected with disharmonic memories the person has from how he was treated in groups during his childhood. He might have felt malice, hate or jealousy from other kids at school, being the scapegoat, the alien, the rejected one. This subconsciously influences the way he perceives such types of experiences during his adult life. Also, there are possibilities that he was feeling ashamed during such occasions, which can in turn create a strong drive to take a symbolic revenge. \n \n\n\nAs the 11th house is the realm of Uranus and Aquarius, Lilith’s presence feeds the desire of being different and unique, which can even lead to provocative extremes. This can lead to becoming a member of weird subcultures, concerning one’s clothes, music and lifestyle. This style is definitely something absurd for the average people, which will see the native as awkward. Thus, alienation from the others is something which can frequently happen. Lilith in the 11th house is responsible for not being called to parties or other collective events. In extreme cases, it can even bring being hated by collectivities and groups. Of course, this triggers a similar reaction. Hating those groups back.\nOn the other hand, such a native will enjoy friendships that are based on one-to-one principles. There is high possibility that such a person’s friends have also their Lilith in the 11th house. Social outcasts and loners, which have experienced the same fears and traumas, tend to blend better with people of their own kin.\nLilith has a lot of seductive traits and characteristics, thus giving strong sexuality to the individual’s friendships. Such a placement can easily give “friends with benefits”, and a sexual atmosphere will be always present in the native’s friendships. Yet, if Lilith is ill-aspected, such relations can bring drama and disasters.  Lilith can cause dark feelings such as jealousy or hate, and when adversely aspected indicates betrayals. An 11th house Lilith person will be suspicious and possessive about his friends. This gives the stereotype of hating other people that hang out with his friends, due to the fear of losing them or becoming less important for them. It is even more potent when sexual desire is present in the situation. This placement can make someone be in a love/hate relation with his friends, pathologically adoring them but at the same time blaming them for anything wrong that happens in the native’s life.\nThe 11th house is the realm of group sexual activity, and Lilith can trigger quite promiscuous patterns of behaviors to the native. Aquarian and Uranian energy is very open for experimentations, and such natives are more open for ménage a trois and swinging. If Lilith is in Scorpio, Capricorn or adversely affected by malefics, she can lead to dangerous games in the native’s love life. In such occasions the native should be very careful of dramatic emotional events that can happen between him and friends. It is very probable that at least one of the persons involved in this complicated situation will get hurt. When Lilith is adversely aspecting Pluto, Mars or Saturn, such a chart owner might even enjoy using and hurting people emotionally. \n \n\n\nIn case this happens, the individual should review his childhood to see whether he was emotionally hurt by friends in his early ages. Very frequently, he will discover that potential negative behaviors to people he is related to may be a subconscious revenge towards the archetype of “friend”. The scars which remain from that disappointment in his young age may make him use all his weapons to possess his friends, including sexuality. On a higher level, the chart owner may not be even really sexually attracted to his friends, and just using sex in order to hold a tight grip on them.\nLilith’s presence in the eleventh house can make someone a cunning schemer concerning organizations. He might sabotage social groups, spread malice between their members and cause a lot of discord. The native might feel happy when seeing groups of people fall apart. This will fulfill his dark pleasures, as he feels he teaches the other people a lesson about how it is to be left without a social group. Of course, such an unhealthy behavior is more frequently present to people who have hard aspects to their Lilith.\nThe best way of softening the difficult traits of Lilith is symbolically indulging in 11th house matters where the ego dissolves in a group gestalt, and is recomposed in a different way. If you have such an aspect, try to join any type of organization, and to behave well. Concentrate on promoting harmony between the members, and try to keep your darker traits away from your behavior. Of course, there are many techniques one can use to partially get rid of the difficult traits that Lilith gives. Nevertheless, all forms of communication within a group, and collective work are very good channels for letting our darkness flow away from us.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:18:15'),

Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 10th can complicate how an individual appears in the eyes of the others. Lilith is quite visible to the masses around him, and will be always present in his image. Yet, as the 10th house is ruled by Capricorn and Saturn, the energy of Lilith blends quite well with their dark traits. Thus, she can be even used quite well in a conscious manner, so that the native acquires fame – even if it is negative. As we all know, negative advertisement is still marketing, and maybe even the strongest way to promote one’s persona.\nThese dark traits of Lilith may be connected with disharmonic memories the person has from his parent that was mostly dominant during childhood. The 10th house rules the dominant parent, and usually it is the chart owner’s father. Lilith placed there despises his authority, and can reach extremes in order to manifest rebellion towards him. A common pattern that can appear, especially in women charts, is hatred towards any men who have similar characteristics like her father.\nIn addition, such a person can develop wrath towards any type of authority, and can be a very difficult worker. He will create problems to his employers, disrespect them and maybe even sabotage them. If the native has a career of his own, he may treat his employees in a vicious way too. This phenomenon is quite common when Lilith squares some malefic planet located in the 6th house.\nA 10th house Lilith will create great lust of power and the need to control. The native may even use his sexuality to seduce people of higher status, in order to rise in the social pyramid. Lilith has a lot of seductive traits and characteristics, thus giving strong sexuality to the individual’s career. Yet, Lilith does not develop healthy love affairs, and in case she is activated in one’s job surroundings she will most naturally bring discord.\nIn some cases, when Lilith is adversely aspected, the native will get involved in scandals. Those scandals can even be of a sexual type, and there will be negative criticism by people of his surroundings. On the other hand, he might achieve all his goals even with the help of such negative criticism. The fuss that is created around his name can make the chart owner even more known and powerful, which later can be used to climb easily higher in the social pyramid. \n \n\n\nAs the 10th house is the realm of Capricorn, Black Moon Lilith can be cruel and manipulative towards the people she can control. Such a person may more easily step on corpses in order to achieve fame and success, and will not hesitate to backstab someone in his job surroundings.\nA 10th house Lilith may indicate a lot of jealousy towards successful people. The native will do detailed research about how someone can become famous, and create his own strategy. These strategic plans will of course be secret, and the native may be denying their existence even to close friends. In addition, such strategies may be based on quite dubious moral values, which is also another reason for them remaining clandestine. Of course, one should keep in mind that the 10th house is probably the most noticeable to others, and there is high risk of having such plans revealed. \n \n\n\nCuriously enough, such a placement is perfect for artistic performers. There is probably no better placement for dancers, as their raw sexuality radiates through Lilith in the eyes of the audience. In their movements, dark seduction can be easily noticed; Lilith adores to control sexually the minds of others. Obviously, Lilith in the 10th is a great placement for politics too. With good aspects, she can do miracles; with difficult ones though, she can even contribute to one’s fall through scandal and revelation of secrets. \n \n\n\nThe best way of softening the difficult traits of Lilith is consciously changing your approach towards the dark energy she carries. A necessary procedure is to forgive any people from childhood that gave rough archetypes, and find ways to channel any negative energy into constructive actions. Eventually, you will notice that your mind will become clearer, and a lot of negative emotions will gradually dissolve. Lower your pride and become less cunning; plotting and scheming is not the only way to reach success. You will eventually observe that when you start radiating positive emotions, the masses will start following you through being inspired and not provoked.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:18:21'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way. \n \n\n\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet. \n \n\n\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather dark point of an individual’s natal chart. This most furthest spot that the Moon reaches from the Earth makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 9th house is not the best placement, as most astrologers claim she is in fall in the sign of Sagittarius. Indeed, the Jupiterian energies that rule this house are quite difficult to blend well with her dark powers. As the ninth house is considered the house of filosophy, Lilith can make one’s personal views fairly dogmatic, and give a lot of obscure traits. People with such a placement may use their religious beliefs or spiritual ideas in order to impose them to masses, and even control them. There can be an addiction to power connected with teaching. Such an individual may indulge in drinking other people’s energy through transforming their beliefs, or just shuttering stable beliefs that others have. This is not necessary negative, because the chart owner can be a radical person who actually helps the society progress through destroying stereotypes. Possible roles that such a person can play are that of the troll, the cynicist, the taboo-breaker and possibly uses black humor.\nThe 9th house is ruling higher education, and Lilith’s effect is to neglect the principles that education can offer. The individual does not recognize the universities, institutions and professors as authority, and will frequently abandon studying. This, of course, does not abandon learning. Such a native will prefer to learn by himself, and quickly turn towards more practical areas of life such as work. Indeed, wisdom gained through practice can be more beneficial for him than anything theoretical. In case that the native chooses to finish his studies, he will be constantly nervous and distracted, being even a bad influence for other students around him. His rebellious character cannot accept being put in patterns and borders that a higher authority imposes.\nA ninth house Lilith person will not hesitate to spread a misleading idea, and even create a wave of people that will follow it. If your natal Lilith has difficult aspects with Mars or Mercury, be very careful of what you are teaching other people. Also, if your natal Lilith squares a planet in the 12th house, your tongue will definitely create some hidden enemies; generally try to think a lot before starting preaching a certain idea which you know can create discord.\nLilith in the 9th house can create irritations connected with distant travels, and the chart owner might be approached by foreigners who have a strong Lilith in their chart. This can bring unexpected situations and power games between them, as the native will despise in them some negative traits he knows he has too.\nBlack Moon Lilith’s presence in the 9th house of an individual can have an influence on his style of writing, or in special situations lead him towards publishing radical scripts. He may be drawn towards writing dark poems and literature, involve deep sexuality in his writings or elsehow express very deep and archetypical layers of his soul. Lilith can even trigger sick imagination, which will be considered quite radical and taboo by other people. This natal aspect can aid a lot anyone who is interested in alternative literature, as his works are definitely not for the masses. Except for a writer, such a person could also become a publisher, and even achieve great success if Jupiter or Venus are present. Of course, any possible conjunction with Mercury further enhances any attempt of that.\nAnother characteristic that Lilith in the 9th house can give, is making the individual a state-of-the-arts liar. Any person with such a placement can perfectly masquerade his lies under his words, diverting the other people’s attention and generally be a master of deceit. His lies can be even having a strong theoretical background, a whole filosophy behind them. This will make them be easily believed, especially from the masses.\nBlack Moon Lilith in the 9th house can lead to sexual adventures with foreigners or people other religion. In any case, the native may be making long and distant trips for sexual reasons, have sexual partners in faraway countries and maybe even pass secretly a lot of time in a distant place.\nIn case you have Lilith in the ninth house, try to think before creating a cult around an idea. Your ability to influence others with your words is very strong, so choose consciously and wisely before you do it. It is always better to express your darkness through ways that will not have negative effects on others. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:18:29'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way.  Most astrologers, websites, programs and ephemeris calculate and use Black Moon Lilith. \n \n\n\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart.

Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 8th can complicate an individual’s sexual expression. It may be connected with disharmonic memories the person has concerning sexuality, obtained in his childhood. This does not imply sexual harassment, but the native probably has experienced the darker parts of sexuality even as an idea since he was young. He might have (accidentally) watched movies that show extreme sexual scenes. Alternatively, he may have been raised in environments where sex was described as rough and cruel. As the young person’s mind is a sponge, he absorbs those information deep in the subconscious, categorizing sex as a rather traumatic experience.\nSuch a native connects sex with death, and this is what the 8th house is all about. For him, sex is a strong simulation of death. Death can many times be violent, and those darker shades are also passed towards his sexuality. An 8th house Lilith person will enjoy extreme games and BDSM, while sometimes reach even cruelty in bed. Lilith can bring fantasies of pain, torture, humiliation or even rape. It awakens the beast, the animalistic sexual depths that do not allow the flourishing of emotions. They will never indulge in having vanilla sexual relationships; they prefer everything that is rough and animalistic. \n \n\n\nIn addition, the secrecy that the 8th house offers combined with the dark powers of Lilith will give them tendencies of unfaithfulness. On the contrary, they will not tolerate their partner being unfaithful; discreet spying and checking might be easily a technique they will use to control him. Sex can become for them an uncontrolled obsession, and their affairs will be rather cruel from both sides concerning feelings. On the other hand it will strengthen the carnal pleasure to a maximum, with both them and their partners enjoying very intense situations. \n \n\n\nWith Lilith in the 8th house, an individual can become a sexual manipulator. He likes to control the desires of his partners, and feed on their sexuality. In extreme cases and with Lilith having malefic aspects, the native will become a sexual vampire. The person’s sexual drive is so magical that other people find it rather difficult to defend. An 8th house Lilith person can be compared to a Siren; singing her beautiful and seductive song to the sailors – yet being a dangerous creature that can devour. \n \n\n\nAs the 8th house is the realm of Pluto, Lilith’s presence feeds the desire of owning other people’s possessions. We should not forget that the house is ruling other people’s money, and such a placement can also indicate a person that enjoys using resources of his partners. Again, in some extreme cases, this can be part of a plan. Ever heard of Black Widows, female spiders? Well, if there is a placement that can describe them, this is it! The 8th house rules death inheritance, and Lilith would easily drive such a person to wait for someone to die in order to obtain his wealth. An ill-aspected Lilith will impose difficulties in receiving the inheritance, and generally unpleasant and dramatic situations concerning death. There is high possibility that a death during the natives childhood has created such a traumatic pattern that will continue to reappear.\n8th house Lilith creates a mystical persona, and makes the chart owner rather secretive. On the other hand, the house of Pluto and Scorpio makes them particularly strong in uncovering secrets of others. Their powerful abilities are what makes them afraid that their own secrets will be uncovered by similar people, thus leading them to become over-protective about their own sensitive information.\nOf course, we should keep in mind that a well-aspected Lilith does not bear all that darkness. With such aspects, the person will just have enormous sexuality, and can even use it for healing. In addition, the native will have a lot of occult powers, and is advised to be careful with their implementation. Due to the fact that Lilith carries a lot of dark energy, he might feel tempted to cause malice even without a reason. In case you have such a natal placement, it is better to abstain from all types of magic until you consciously know what you use and what type of effects you want it to have on other people and you.\nA person with Lilith in this house will battle with inner fears of failing in matters connected with the 8th house. The fear of death will make him use symbolical simulations of death. This is a procedure which most of the times happens unconsciously; the soul is preparing itself for the grand passage through small doses of symbolic deaths during all its lifetime.\nBe extremely careful of people that have their 8th house Lilith conjuncting Pluto or Mars, or any difficult aspects of her to the malefics. In case you have such placements, consider giving love a chance in your life. It is many times the absence of love that transforms a tender person to a vicious beast.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:18:37'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart. This topographical extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the seventh house can complicate an individual’s marriage or long relationships. The native is in need of uniting with someone darker than him. Lilith makes them feel attracted to people of a mischievous character and dubious morality. 7th house people are often very kind and naïve, and therefore search for the exact opposite in order to balance their own behaviors. \n \n\n\nThis is created by a subconscious need to see the dark traits of Lilith in other people, so that they do not need to manifest through the native himself. Thus, it is quite natural that he is turning towards people with a strongly emphasized Lilith in their charts. For example, their significant others may have Lilith in the 1st house or conjunct the Ascendant, which is symmetrically an opposite situation than the native’s. Alternatively, their partner’s Lilith can be conjuncting important personal planets, thus granting them obscure attributes. Yet, these are not some rules that always are valid. The partner might be expressing his darkness through other ways too. Tough aspects between Pluto, Saturn and the Moon seem to be the most common in giving such dark characteristics. \n \n\n\nOf course, this natal placement of Lilith can be quite tricky. The native is having his life gates open for inviting individuals who may harm him. In some occasions, the chart owner might be even enjoying difficult relationships with people that might even repulse him. With hard aspects, he might receive pleasure in feeling victimized. Yet, a frequent pattern that appears is the native trying to soften the difficult character of his spouse or partner. He may feel an internal need to turn the sinner into a saint, to tame the wild beast and make it a lamb. In case that Lilith is positively aspected, the odds can be on the native’s side and help him succeed.\nOf course, such transformations are not the easiest thing to happen. A 7th house Lilith indicates that one’s partners may have extremely strong sexual instincts, a rebellious character and even self-destructive tendencies. In any occasion, such unions are rather problematic and usually demand from the native to invest a lot of effort in accepting the difficult parts of their partner’s psyche.\nIn addition, as the 7th house is ruling one’s business partners, the chart owner should be even more careful than when choosing his beloved ones. Failing in love or marriage can have emotional consequences; yet failing in business can be even more catastrophic. It is not wise to collaborate with people you already feel that can take advantage of you. A seventh house Lilith may bring a snake at your business doorstep; consider well before uniting your powers with it.\nWe should not forget that the 7th house is the realm of one’s open enemies, and Lilith will make them quite vicious. Moreover, if she is adversely aspected, be sure that you’re your ex-partners (no matter if in business or in love) will not hesitate to turn against you after your relations end.\nOf course, Lilith can also become a great teacher. The difficulties that she can bring in the native’s relations will definitely make him a stronger person. He will eventually become conscious about the problematic people he attracts, and also develop his own dark side, which is usually repressed.\nWhen Lilith resides in the 7th house, it can very frequently bring divorce. Bad aspects to her indicate troubles concerning the procedure of getting divorced, and usually bring matters to court. When the native’s marriage involves having children, this placement will most probably lead to intense battles concerning their custody. The same pattern appears in a business partnerships; the dissolution of the established company may need to pass through law and can be a lengthy procedure. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in our conversations!

It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart. This topographical extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative. \n \n\n\nHaving Lilith in the 5th can complicate an individual’s recreational expression. It may be connected with disharmonic memories the person has from how he played in the childhood. He might have felt malice, hate or jealousy from other kids during games, dancing or sports activities, which subconsciously influences the way he perceives such types of experiences during his adult life. Also, there are possibilities that he was feeling ashamed during such occasions, which can in turn create a strong drive to take a symbolic revenge towards the world during such situations. \n \n\n\nAs the 5th house is the realm of Leo, Lilith’s presence feeds the desire of being appreciated, which naturally leads to showing off very frequently. The native needs to feel being the central actor on stage, and will frequently even develop underground strategies in order to achieve it. This can lead him even to take dancing lessons in order to dance better, build stereotypes of catchy behaviors to use them while partying, and generally find ways to attract the eyes of other people in order to cause admiration.\nLilith has a lot of seductive traits and characteristics, thus giving strong sexuality to the individual in this placement during these recreational activities. Yet, it can also cause dark feelings such as jealousy or hate from other people in the same surroundings, especially those that perceive the individual as an antagonist. And there are usually more than a few other people also desiring to be the epicenter of attention, so Lilith can create quite a lot of power games “on the dancefloor”.\nIn addition, as the 5th house is ruling one’s first child and the relations with children in general, Lilith can bring discomfort in such matters. This placement can make someone be in a love/hate relation with his children, pathologically adoring them but at the same time blaming them for the sacrifice of his leisure activities in order to spend time with them.\nThe 5th house is the realm of casual sex, and Lilith can bring quite promiscuous patterns of behaviors to the native. Especially if she is in Scorpio, or adversely affected by malefics, she can lead to dangerous games in the native’s love life. This will bring quite a lot of partners, constant flirting and secretive activities. Both the individual and his partners may be severely hurt through such behaviors, and the native might even enjoy using and hurting people emotionally. In case this happens, the individual should review his childhood to see whether he was emotionally hurt in love in his early ages. Very frequently, he will discover that potential negative behaviors to people he has affairs with may be a subconscious revenge towards the archetype of “erotic partner”, due to scars left from that love disappointment in his young age. If you have this placement, be careful with your urges to cheat on your significant other. It may hurt him a lot, and also your children-if you have any.\nGenerally, Lilith can cast an obscure shadow over the native’s sexuality, bringing dark fantasies of pain, torture or even rape. It awakens the beast, the animalistic sexual depths that do not allow the flourishing of emotions. Casual sex can become for them an uncontrolled obsession, and their affairs will be rather cruel from both sides concerning feelings. On the other hand it will strengthen the carnal pleasure to a maximum, with both them and their partners enjoying very intense situations. \n \n\n\nA person with Lilith in this house will battle with inner fears of failing in matters connected with the 5th house. The fear of rejecting his children might even make him delay the process as much as he can. In addition, there is a tendency to child abuse, or an inner battle with paranoid wishes to do that. \n \n\n\nLilith presence in the fifth house can make someone a cunning speculator, while also lead him to gambling games in which he will not be fair. Cheating in them will not only bring money but also fulfill the dark pleasure of tricking the other person. This unhealthy behavior is more frequently present to people who have hard aspects to their Lilith. Of course, the hard aspects usually also make him get caught and bring various other problems and misbalances afterwards.\nThe best way of softening the difficult traits of Lilith is symbolically indulging in 5th house matters where the ego dissolves and is recomposed in a different character. Join an amateur theatre organization, and act. To your alter ego that is acting, pass all your negative urges and fears. With the help of this alter ego, you will be able to somehow cleanse your real self. Of course, there are many techniques one can use to partially get rid of the difficult behaviors that Lilith gives. Nevertheless, all forms of art and creation are very good channels for letting our darkness flow away from us.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:20:17'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where the Moon&#8217;s transits are most distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather dark point of an individual’s natal chart. The distance extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 4th house is considered a rather unfortunate natal placement, as it directly affects one’s childhood years and family. Astrologers claim that Lilith’s detriment is the sign Cancer, and thus the traditional home of Cancer is by no means a good place for her to dwell.\nThe native’s early years are disharmonic and there are problems with at least one parent. The fourth house is responsible for the less dominant one, which in most cases is the person’s mother. Lilith can give an unloving mother that abandons her child, or does not dedicate a lot of time to it. There are a lot of possibilities that she is dedicating more time to her sexuality than raising the young native, and Lilith’s sexuality is a rather obscure matter.\nIn many occasions, Black Moon Lilith’s presence can bring divorce of the parents due to unfaithfulness or other reasons connected with sexuality. The child feels as an observer, incapable either to understand or to soften things between its parents. In many occasions, the native himself is an offspring of lust rather than love, and even if his parents decide to live together and try to create a family the odds are against them. Step-parents can also be involved in the child’s early years, and it largely depends on other factors and aspects to determine their nature. \n \n\n\nAs a result, Lilith may cause similar problems when the native wants to create a family for himself. Her presence in the house of home is far from creating a sanctuary, and there will be even similar characteristics in the situations between the native and his spouse as his parents had.\nThe 4th house Lilith individual tends to dedicate his time and effort in matters of the exact opposite house, the 10th. He may develop great career abilities and uses his work as a gateway to escape from being at home. In extreme cases with very difficult aspects, Lilith will create a person who uses his residence just for sleeping and prefers to pass the biggest amount of his time elsewhere.\nThe 4th is the house of one’s roots, and Lilith can bring a lot of secrecy about the native’s ancestors. There can be dark powers running in the blood of some female ancestors. In addition, the native may have experienced a lot of poisonous relations with family members. He feels a scapegoat and rejected, and the natural outcome of his life is alienation from his roots. In case that Lilith is adversely aspected by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the young individual might have experienced a lot of physical punishment. In lighter cases or with good aspects, verbal abuse is more frequent.\nOf course, such difficult surroundings may also bring positive outcomes. Being trained in how to survive in difficult situations, the native becomes a strong character and can excel in his career- especially the type of authority positions that involve control. \n \n\n\nThe possible negative ancestral karma can run quite deep, and sometimes a wise decision for such a native is to not form a family in order to break the cycle that repeats the same patterns. Of course, this does not apply to people who have strong benefic planets in the houses of marriage, children and family. \n \n\n\nIf you have this placement, you might unravel that you possess deep instincts of emotionally harming people. As we already mentioned fourth house is traditionally ruled by Cancer and the Moon, and Lilith will frequently lure you to hurt the Moon power of other people. If you notice such types of behaviors try to deactivate them, as they are subconscious programs copied from your parents’ behaviors. You have a great chance to end these cycles – and taming Lilith can unify your light and dark side into a balanced whole.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:20:21');

Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 3rd house is considered a good placement, as most astrologers claim she feels exalted in the sign Gemini. Thus, in the 3rd house she is domicile, and mostly manifests as an unquenchable thirst for communication and information. Of course, as it is Lilith we are speaking about, the means of receiving that information might be highly dubious. A third house Lilith person will not hesitate to overhear a conversation, gossip, or use other obscure means of gaining knowledge about things that interest him. If your natal Lilith has difficult aspects with Mars or Mercury, be very careful of what rumors you spread. Also, if your natal Lilith squares a planet in the 12th house, your tongue will definitely create some hidden enemies; generally try to think a lot before revealing sensitive information of others.\nAs the 3rd house rules ones siblings, this natal placement can indicate a person that is using his siblings to empower his own purposes. Lilith may indicate lies towards them, and when she is ill-aspected these can even have a lot of effects on the relationships with brothers and sisters. In any case, a person with such a natal Lilith will definitely wear a mask towards the siblings, having a hidden agenda. This, nevertheless, does not indicate that there will not be love between them. The emotions can be totally real and even harmonious. A well-aspected Lilith will mostly lead to the ability of manipulating, without this being frequently implemented in reality. \n \n\n\nBlack Moon Lilith’s presence in the 3rd house of an individual can have an influence on his style of writing. He may be drawn towards writing dark poems and literature, involve deep sexuality in his scripts or elsehow express very deep and archetypical layers of his soul. Lilith can even trigger sick imagination, which will be considered quite radical and taboo by other people. This natal aspect can aid a lot anyone who is interested in alternative literature, as his works are definitely not for the masses. \n \n\n\nThe 3rd house is ruling one’s early education, and the presence of the Black Moon shows some problems in school. Those are mostly dependant on the communication with other pupil, and Lilith can bring all type of negative feelings. An early heartbreak from your first crush, wrath and jealousy towards the strongest pupil, mistreating and being mistreated, power games inside the classroom. Of course, most children are getting involved in such types of stories. Nevertheless, those who have Lilith in the 3rd house tend to experience them as utterly important for their reality.\nAnother characteristic that Lilith in the 3rd house can give, is making the individual a state-of-the-arts liar. Any person with such a placement can perfectly masquerade his lies under his words, diverting the other people’s attention and generally be a master of deceit. Her presence in the 3rd house can also have an effect on the native’s voice, making it seductive or even creepy. In any case, the people around him perceive his voice as weird and dark, and the native may have tendencies to whisper.\nBlack Moon Lilith in the 3rd house can lead to sexual adventures with neighbors or people who generally live in the neighborhood; in extreme situations can bring attraction towards a cousin. In any case, the native may be making short trips for sexual reasons, have sexual partners in nearby cities and maybe even pass secretly a lot of weekends with a hidden lover. \n \n\n\nIn case you have Lilith in the third house, try to think before speaking as your tongue might have a lot of poison. Your ability to pain others with your words is very strong, so choose consciously and wisely before you do it. It is always better to express your darkness through art, than directly and uncontrolled towards other people.\nDo not forget to like our&nbsp;Facebook Page&nbsp;and join our&nbsp;Astrology Community Facebook Group&nbsp;to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:20:25'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith. \n \n\n\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet. \n \n\n\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather dark point of an individual’s natal chart. The distance extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as a negative spot.\nWhen Lilith is located in the second house of a natal chart, she desires material possessions. She can be very thirsty of obtaining wealth, while also objects that stick in her mind. Especially when adversely aspected by Mars, Pluto or even benefics such as Venus and Jupiter, Lilith can become overly greedy. She likes to exceed the limits, and her unquenchable traits may make the native become a wealth-vampire. The native’s approach towards money might be of a secret nature; or even hidden deep in his subconscious. For the outer world, the individual might be seeming to renounce money; yet in the inside he is quite a lot burning for it.\nYet, this by no means implies that his urge to achieve material possessions will be successful. His second house has a lot more important indicators about his financial growth. If no prosperity is shown by the planets and ruler of the house, Lilith might remain thirsty, complicating furthermore the individual’s approach towards things he owns.\nMoney can become a real obsession, while also can anything else the native believes should be under his control. This includes also people, ideas, virtually everything he feels he has a grip on. Lilith can obscure and obstruct his mind, not allowing him think out thoroughly and find the correct ways of obtaining the desired objects.\nIn case you have this placement, keep in mind that the tricky traits of Lilith can mislead into desiring things that are actually unnecessary, just for the sake of experiencing their obtainment. You should definitely halt and consider whether your pursuits lead towards happiness or are just a game of your mind, a vicious hunt of a delusion that actually does not grant you real pleasure. \n \n\n\nAs the 2nd house is ruling money, Lilith placed there not only creates a hassle with gaining them but also likes to spend recklessly. The native with such a placement can be quite unable to handle his money, and overspending can become an addiction. Also, another issue that he might experience concerning finances is being used and tricked by other people. Furthermore, the individual can even become overly stingy if Lilith is adversely connected with Saturn.\nLilith is connected with the fear of rejection, and her presence in the 2nd house indicates that the individual is afraid that the society does not approve his handling of possessions and wealth. This subconscious fear, though, leads him towards even more provocative actions. Indeed, the society might not even notice his patterns of obtaining and spending money, but his fear urges him to express himself in an unhealthy way. In the end, especially if Lilith is adversely aspected, he gets both noticed and criticized, which fact he later uses in order to reassure himself for the righteousness of his fears.\nIndividuals with Lilith in the 2nd house should guard against materialism, and one of the best ways to make her dark traits milder is to learn to share your resources. The native must disconnect the terms security and money, and learn to not feel inferior when he has less than others. In addition, as Lilith is also connected with sexuality, such a native should search for emotional traumas connected with possessions and belongings. The patterns of Lilith might be all outcomes of an erotic rejection in his early sexual life, somehow linked to his social class or wealth. If you have experienced such a rejection, un-root it and you will see Lilith functioning in a totally different way.\nBecause indeed, she can be a magnificent teacher and offer you all types of hedonisms – as long as you take the thorn out of her heart. And in the 2nd house, a healed Lilith will offer you exactly what the house implies. And that you secretly (or even openly) desire.\nDo not forget to like our&nbsp;Facebook Page&nbsp;and join our&nbsp;Astrology Community Facebook Group&nbsp;to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:20:40'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather dark point of an individual’s natal chart. The distance extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as a negative spot. \n \n\n\nWhen Lilith is located in the 1st house of a natal chart, she is strongly connected to one’s physical self, both the body and the mind. In case that she is conjuncting the Ascendant, the native will be oozing of dark sexuality, becoming an object of desire for other people. Lilith in the first house can give a very hot body, and especially in a woman’s chart can make her so attractive that other people can become obsessed with her figure. Also, Lilith placed here may indicate very bad relations with the female’s father. He can be of a violent nature, and the chart owner will frequently reproduce patterns of violent explosions in her own life.\nIn addition, the presence of Black Moon Lilith in the first house can give a tendency to wear black and morbid clothes, and generally have a rather dark and alternative style. The traits are quite common as having Pluto in the house, yet Lilith brings a less serious approach to clothing – the individual desires to look extraordinary and differ from the rest of the community. Also, taboo themes such as death and sex will be used as art and style to provoke the masses. A first house Lilith person will easily wear sculls, crosses, pentacles and everything else that will make him pass as dark in the other people’s minds.\nMoreover, Lilith in the first house can also give a rather provocative character. The person who has this placement can have tendencies of acting “bitchy”, indulge in mind games and manipulations and even receive pleasure from confrontations with other people. Having enemies may be a source of personal power, and they do not seem to be discouraged when not being liked by others. In fact, this helps them create an even more strong and eccentric persona, frequently making their appearance and behavior be gossiped by the society. They take pride when other people notice them and discuss them, even if it is in a negative way. \n \n\n\nAs the 1st house is associated with the native’s body and how he treats it, Lilith will spawn her magic in the native’s everyday reality through quite a lot of means. Sex and drugs can frequently appear in the native’s life, especially if Lilith makes aspects with important planets. Good aspects can even show a very responsible use of these power sources, turning the native into a very spiritual being – even if he follows darker roads towards higher consciousness. \n \n\n\nAn adversely aspected Lilith can make the native have quite a lot of personal demons, and suffer from existential questions and dilemmas. Lilith in bad aspect to Mars, Pluto or other malefics can bring tendencies of self-abuse, love of pain and all types of perversions involving symbolical suffering. When in a water sign or negatively aspected to Neptune, a first House Lilith can give substance addiction.\nOn the other hand, taming Lilith’s dark powers can grant the native a fruitful life full of sexuality, while also a mind that can connect to deeper realms and understand the functions of hypnotism. In any case, the native can seduce others easily even if he does not understand the mechanism behind such phenomena.\nIn case you have this natal placement, understanding how to better channel the obscure energies of Lilith will help you very much avoid any negative effects. Be careful to hold back feelings of revenge, as it can backfire at you. Also, hold yourself away from self-destruction, even if it may appear as a vice that you enjoy. Know that you are easily noticed by others, your energy cannot just pass unnoticed; thus, there is no real need of over-exaggerating in your appearance and behavior. And finally, try to keep away from trouble! In case your life indeed has quite a lot, you will understand that most of the times it was your choice to get into trouble. Yes, this produces adrenalin; but if you consciously do it then do not be grumpy about it.\nDo not forget to like our&nbsp;Facebook Page&nbsp;and join our&nbsp;Astrology Community Facebook Group&nbsp;to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:20:51'),
(1632, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-12th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Mars in the 12th house can be a rather disturbing or even dangerous placement, as its presence here indicates difficulties of expressing one’s anger and aggressive emotions. This can have as a result violent explosions when the oppressed energy reaches a critical level, and people with such an aspect must definitely learn techniques of anger-management.\nA twelfth house Mars indicates that the native can have been bullied as a child, or even be a victim of physical attack. Even if this did not actually happen, the nature of the 12th house can have brought to the individual a lot of fears concerning physical violence. As a child, he may have been frequently afraid of being beaten by other children or even his parents. This placement can create traumas or even make the native feel a coward. These fears of being bullied without being able to properly retaliate build a pattern of preferring to flee rather than fight, mostly due to insecurity of the fight’s outcome. The native is afraid of being defeated and will often avoid conflict even with a less powerful opponent, just to be sure that he will not lose.\nAlso, during the childhood years, expressing anger was being kind of forbidden. The native’s parents and other people surrounding him were not tolerating powerful outbursts of the child, which in turn was leading him to have introversive implosions rather than a healthy direction of possible negative emotions. Holding those feelings inside definitely brings feelings of restlessness, and such repressing tendencies either make him burst when anger reaches a threshold or (in more difficult situations) bring a lot of self-undoing and&nbsp; auto-destructive actions. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, Mars placed in the 12th can give a lot of power connected with the occult fields. The individual can channel his energy into studying and understanding the spiritual realms, and dedicate quite a lot of effort. Usually, as Martial energy brings actions, the individual will not only theoretically study the occult but also get involved in its practice. In case that Mars is adversely aspected, especially by malefics such as Pluto and Saturn, the person is&nbsp; advised to stay away from magickal practice because he can both create a lot of hidden enemies but also hurt other people and himself. A badly aspected Mars shows that he has no firm control of his energy and violent emotions, and thus he can even cause conscious malice to others when his wrath or hatred go beyond control.\nA person with natal Mars in the 12th house is strongly advised to strengthen its function, and the best way is by indulging into an active life. Sports, martial arts and all activities that empower the body can heal the native’s self-confidence, providing to Mars the necessary energy- and especially the necessary channels for it to flow outwards. In addition, such a native should battle his fears of anger expression and allow such outbursts. Even the fact of de-demonizing them will have a positive effect, as he will no longer struggle by burying such emotions deep in his psyche. \n \n\n\nIn some situations, the newborn individual may have experienced pain during childbirth. This can in turn make him feel that the world outside of his mother’s womb is violent and threatening. If Mars is with adversely aspected, the individual can develop fears and paranoia concerning war and mass calamities. Indeed, Mars in the twelfth there is not the best placement for such events, especially if it is located near the Ascendant. A twelfth house Mars person should try to keep away from guns, wars, demonstrations and sharp machineries, as there are quite a lot of possibilities to have an accident. \n \n\n\nMars in the 12th house can indeed bring hidden enemies, especially males. But what is more frequent to happen is phobias about having hidden enemies, even if they do not exist. Actually, the appearance of some real enemies among friends will make the native cautious in his approach, always searching for hidden behaviors in other people near him. Being backstabbed in the past makes him want to prevent that happen again, so he will many times even become paranoiac, imagining hidden tactics in other people’s movements. In addition, his alert makes him always ready to strike first, and there are quite a lot of possibilities that he will accidentally hurt someone just because of fear of being hurt.\nAs the 12th house is connected with social institutions, the native may have some involvement with prisons, hospitals or monasteries. If Mars has positive aspects, the native may gain quite a lot of experience from working on such projects in institutions of restriction. On the other hand, difficult aspects can indicate bad luck with those, so a native is firmly advised to keep far from any criminal activity as it may bring a legal trouble and possibilities of imprisonment. Seriously, with a 12th house Mars, the risks of getting caught are quite big, as also the chances of betrayal from a friend who is a snitch.

(1633, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-9th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nMars in the 9th house is probably one of the best natal positions he can have, at least concerning the native himself. Mars will activate all the 9th house matters, which involve things that the masses do not usually reach; a lot of distant travels, a good education as long as relocation to a place that the native prefers to live.\nThe native will be able to channel tremendous amounts of energy towards higher education and learning. In addition, as the ninth house rules publishing, he will most probably write something that will be read from the masses. This might be connected with religion, travel, sports or even military matters. People with this natal placement can become accomplished in teaching, usually on the same subjects that are already mentioned. Mars in the 9th creates the sports trainer, the geopolitics writer, while also may make the person write about machinery and martial arts. A usual phenomenon is that he develops a circle of fan readers, whom he may easily manipulate and use for his causes.\nMars in the 9th house gives a strong interest in religion, making the native dedicate a lot of time in reading various books and writings. This placement creates the preacher and the missionary, and the person may indulge in attempts of converting others to his religion through proselytism. In cases that Mars is negatively aspected, he will be a religious fanatic or a zealot, trying to push his beliefs on other people. Of course, in such occasions he will meet resistance and his aggressive perceptions will have an adverse effect on himself. People who have their natal Mars in the 9th house are so sure about the correctness of their opinion, that become narrow-minded and offensive towards alternate views. On the other hand, they have a quite honest approach to these matters: they firmly believe in what they say and are ready to defend it by any means. Mars here gives a love of debating, and of course makes the native enjoy victories. \n \n\n\nThis natal placement will make the person travel a lot to distant places, and his activities there can also be connected with some kind of sport. In case that Mars is adversely aspected by malefics, the native might suffer some kind of incident in his distant travels. Tensions could arise with locals due to religious, cultural or racial differences, while it can also happen that he arrives to the country during political turmoil and destabilization. In such chaotic circumstances, he can be attacked or survive other types of dangerous situations; in the most extreme form he could witness some kind of war. Of course, if Mars is well-aspected only good can come from foreign places, always depending on which planets form sextiles and squares- while also the houses they are located in. \n \n\n\nThe 9th house is traditionally ruled by Jupiter, and the presence of Mars will make the (otherwise harsh) red planet have a rather humoristic approach on reality. The native will have a great sense of humor and will like good jokes. Also, people with his placement tend to laugh a lot, having a zest for life and expansion. Their enthusiasm can move mountains, and their restless heart will not hesitate to do risky steps forward. Such people can easily switch on “YOLO” mood, which if Mars is well-aspected will reward them in a way that no other mortal can experience. Yes, they are the ones that will break their borders of fear and try parachutes, bungee-jumping or other activities that require balls.\nThis natal placement of Mars may give to the native permanent relocation to some distant land, while actually that foreign place is where he will find his spiritual road. Mars in the 9th can make the native relocate due to embracing a new religion, and can even literally mean fighting for it. Mars will fill the native’s heart with fire for this sacred pilgrimage, making it a very important part of his life. \n \n\n\nGetting actively involved in a spiritual path is a wonderful thing. Such an individual can discover his personal truths, which will in turn brighten his existence. The only thing he should be careful of is pressing other people to receive his own truths as their. In order to ascend to higher spiritual levels, one should understand that there is an absolute and universal truth does not exist, and that every person has the right to follow his own path. Provided that the native respects this spiritual rule, he will evolve towards a higher soul and reach inner balances. Becoming a zealot though, will only quench his egoistic thirst of acceptance.

(1634, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-8th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Mars in the 8th house is one of the most potent placements for the fiery planet. Mars is the co-ruler (or old ruler) of Scorpio, before planet Pluto was discovered, and still holds a lot of power over the house’s matters. Being domicile, he will boost sexuality; nevertheless the aggressive nature of the planet can also create problems in life areas ruled by the eighth house.\nMars usually brings a violent death, which happens rather suddenly. This placement could bring a death by a sharp object, a bullet, an accident or war. In case that the planet has good aspects from other celestial bodies, it would bring at least one near-death experience.  The chart owner will get transformed; usually in a very positive way. After that experience, his gates to the other realms will be permanently more open than before, and he may even grant psychic powers.\nThe individual with Mars placed in the eighth will have an interest for the occult; nevertheless the aggressive nature of the planet will probably make him be too hasty; he will try things earlier than he is ready enough. If Mars is adversely aspected there exists a danger of supernatural attacks or experiments that will go wrong.\nThe native’s sexual life will be more than active. Mars positioned in the house of sex will bring fiery traits to his intimate relations and of the strongest thirst for experiences in bed. Sex is for them a very important channel of recharging and letting go all cumulated negativity. They will prefer it violent and will have an aggressive attitude over it. The native’s desire will be very strong, and all relationships will be of a passionate nature. If Mars is adversely aspected with Pluto or with Saturn, the native can become a victim of abuse, usually of a sexual nature. If Mars is well-aspected, it indicates an active breaking of taboos both of the native and his partners. \n \n\n\nMars in the house of other people’s money may bring a lot of quarrels and disagreements in this area. The native may fight over an inheritance, or have problems dividing a property or financial gains with other people. Issues can also arise in his marital life, as Mars in the 8th house indicates a marriage partner that will have financial losses. This can raise tensions inside the marriage partnership concerning joint finances. In addition, this natal aspect can be a bad indication for any type of loan through an institution. The most possible outcome is that the loan will not be paid back, which will furthermore complicate the native’s finances. \n \n\n\nThe native with mars in the 8th house can be of a very jealous nature, easily becoming obsessive about things. When he needs to possess something and sets such a goal, he may dedicate himself totally to it and even use dubious means to get it. This applies not only to money and material things, but also on people that the native wants to feel as being owned by him. With an adversely aspected Mars, the native can become so jealous that he may even exercise violence towards the desired person that betrayed him. \n \n\n\nIf Mars is afflicted by Mercury, these two planets combine in making the individual a successful thief. The 8th house is also ruling money of the banks or the government, and with such an aspect the native might indulge of putting his hand inside the jar. Be careful, because if you grab a lot then the hand might get stuck inside. All these Martian traits described here should be tamed, so that they do not backfire. This mostly applies to the people who see squares, oppositions and difficult conjunctions to his natal Mars, of course. The rest can relax, they probably already have learnt how to control the eruptive character of the red planet.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:21:10'),
(1635, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-7th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving natal Mars in the 7th house can be a rather difficult placement for marital affairs. As the house is traditionally ruled by Libra and Venus, the powerful red planet can bring disturbances if located here; nevertheless there are a lot of other factors to be observed before reaching such conclusions. \n \n\n\nMars might be considered a malefic planet, and indeed is of a rather aggressive nature. When he is ill-aspected, he will always cause tensions to whatever he touches. This could seem also the case when he is located in the house of marriage- but it is not always like that. The definite outcome is that the native’s spouse will be of a competitive and eruptive nature, no matter what kind of aspects Mars has with other planets. And indeed, the native will himself seek such a personality for a partner, as he cannot get attached to passive people. What happens after is a different story though, one that we will try to explain by dividing the situations in categories. Of course, this is only a rough template; every person is different and there is a lot more than black and white in one’s marriage. Well, in this case we are talking about red. The red of passion, which in other situations can be even the red of blood.\nMars tends to bring a marriage partner of a heavy Aries/Mars emphasis in his natal chart. He will frequently have Mars in his first house, and may be of a military background. There is possibility of him doing any type of work connected with uniform: an officer, a soldier, a policeman, a firefighter, an athlete or a surgeon. His character will be rather touchy and eruptive, while his body will be robust, well-shaped and athletic.\nMany times, the body will be a huge reason of attraction towards the partner; the sexual energy created between the two natives will be of the strongest nature- even blinding the natal chart owner.  Generally, if you are seeking for a harmonic marriage and you have this aspect, rethink it. But probably, having this aspect will make you seek the opposite, and ignore this piece advice.\nIn case that Mars is well placed by sign and well aspected, he will bring a person fond of sports and action. The couple can be engaging together in extreme activities, and find their own type of balance through expelling the Martian energy in constructive ways. They can travel together a lot, do extreme sports, both be military or policemen and so on. There will be a lot of competitiveness between them, but in the end they will both progress through it.\nHere, we should again mention that engaging in activities that release the natural aggression of Mars is obligatory. In case they stay too much at home and try to enforce routines, at least one of them will revolt against the other. Mars is in a strong need of releasing the adrenaline that cumulates. If this is not done systematically and in a controlled environment, it eventually reach the point of explosion. This is quite easy to understand. When you re cooking in a casserole, you do not close the lid and just leave it there. Explosion is the natural outcome.\nOn the other hand, an adversely aspected Mars in the 7th house might be more than catastrophic. Watch out, especially for squares, conjunctions and oppositions to Pluto and Saturn. These aspects can make the marriage partner violent, and can even bring physical abuse. The least they will bring is a marital life full of quarrel, with a lot of nerves and high voices. The most possible ending of such a marriage is a divorce, after a lot of trouble; especially for the native that has his Mars in this placement. \n \n\n\nIn business matters, a Mars placed in the 7th can give competitive partners with often disputes too. Roughly the same rules apply here as in the matters of the marriage; both partners will want to exercise power on each other and this will lead to power struggles. With good natal aspects, this will actually lead to a good team with an aggressive approach towards the market and can make them excel in sales. \n \n\n\nAdverse aspects will not only bring failures in business, but also lawsuits that will eventually harm both in some way. Generally, Mars in the 7th does not favor dealings with the law, and the native might even lose his cases due to aggressive behavior in the court. The judges will tend to be prejudiced against him, and even if he is the right one he might seem as the wrongdoer. This natal aspect can bring unpopularity after such a trial, and even public disgrace. In addition, as the 7th house rules one’s open enemies, such people will exist during the entire native’s life and frequently showing their teeth in various ways.\nGenerally, be very careful if you have your Mars placed there. The red planet does not function himself; it always takes two to tango. You are probably a similar strong source of aggression towards your partner, and what you receive is mirroring also what you radiate. Indeed, maybe you receive it in a harsher way and multiplied, but be wise enough to cut the source and direct the explosive energy elsewhere, and those would be some first steps for reaching a necessary balance.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:21:19'),
(1636, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-6th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nIn case that natal Mars of a person is located in the 6th house of his chart, his job will constantly devour the biggest part of his energy. Mars is not joking in this placement; the 6th house is not only ruling one’s work but also his health. Unless the red planet is very well-aspected, the native should be very careful to not over-work and put his health in danger. \n \n\n\nMars brings all kinds of jobs connected with physical strength and the enforcement of power. It also rules uniforms, so when placed here it can create the military, the policeman, the athlete, while also the surgeon. In addition, it gives jobs connected to operating tools and instruments that cut, different types of machinery and everything involving weapons. Thus, there is a wide range of occupations that he gives; even if the rule is that the job will be a rather active one, there are still possibilities of just being employed in a shop that sells knifes, guns or tools. Also, all categories of metallurgy fall under this rulership; this is the natal placement of the blacksmith and common occupations. \n \n\n\nSuch a native is never lazy and can become very frustrated when he sees others procrastinating. His patterns are rather structured, even of a militaristic type. He will wake up very early, spend a lot of hours working and most probably will impose to himself a very strict routine. In addition, he will eat and sleep at the same time every day, follow special diets for long time and preferring clothes of a certain style without changing it. These people know how to make things done, and can accomplish a lot more in a work day than nearly anyone else. Indeed, Mars in the 6th can give superpowers at work. It will also strengthen the leadership abilities of the native; what he says will be done by the ones under him. Quickly and correctly, because if they do not do it as they should, the native will explode towards them. The type of leadership the native develops is usually not the one that inspires, but the one that induces fear. Extremely pushy and very authoritarian, the native will not be liked by many; nevertheless his methods bring results.\nMars in the 6th house can indicate inflammatory disorders and high fevers; the native’s health is easily afflicted by sudden rushes, migraines and all types of diseases that make the body’s temperature rise. Curiously enough, the native’s health issues are strongly connected to anger and conflicts in his work and will follow similar patterns. If Mars is adversely afflicted then there will be frequent quarrels and competition in his job surroundings, which will furthermore create health issues, usually of a quick nature. If the native is of a very violent and argumentative nature and has chronic tendencies to clashes in his job with co-workers or people under him, the anger will definitely manifest as a disease that will need a surgery. Furthermore, difficult aspects to Mars indicate accidents in his job surroundings, mostly connected with machinery, weapons and sharp objects. One thing is sure when Mars is challenged- it brings blood.\nIf you have a difficult Mars and want to soften his functions consider calming yourself down and seeing your work less seriously. Fanaticism should be abandoned and the Martian energy challenged to more recreative activities such as sports. You should definitely become softer towards the people around you; it is not the planet Mars who is to be blamed- it is you, projecting his most violent traits. Thus, the only way to change the possible health difficulties is changing your own perception of your occupation.\nNatal Mars in the 6th house brings a love of aggressive animals. People with this placement will prefer to have an angry Doberman than a friendly poodle, a badass Bulldog than a lazy cat. They usually train it to become violent, which can be a huge mistake as they in the end copy its behavior and become violent too. In case that Mars is afflicted, the animal owner will get in some kind of trouble with his pet, and there is even a chance of being attacked by it some day. With this placement, we definitely advise against obtaining such a pet and training it in a way that will furthermore release the violent energy of Mars. Of course, as you sow so shall you reap; thus do not complain if such a pet as a company will make you more vicious.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written! \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:21:24'),
(1637, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-4th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nThe presence of the fiery planet in the house of family can be a difficult one, as the 4th house is traditionally ruled by Cancer and the Moon. Natal Mars in the 4th house feels frustrated; this is water house and his aggressive temperament can bring upheavals to the emotional emphasis that the Moon grants to all the fourth house issues.\nWhen a native has his natal Mars residing in the 4th house, the red planet is strongly connected with his roots, family and early childhood. This natal position can make the native be an offspring of a family who have military careers, be policemen or elsehow connected with uniforms and law enforcement. The native receives such archetypes that later in his life form a need of him being the leader of his personal “clan”, which can be both his family and more distant relatives. The struggle for a leadership role in the kin might bring out difficulties, as other members may also have the same type of character. On the other hand, such families can become very strong socially, and it is not infrequent that they collectively take part in organized crime or other illegal activities.\nThe native’s parents are usually very strict and authoritarian, while if Mars is adversely aspected there can be a lot of tension in the family affairs. During his childhood, he was pressured and frequently suffered quarrels between the members of his family. His parents are overprotective, while at the same moment controlling and easily angered. If the natal aspects to Mars are very adverse, the native can suffer physical abuse- especially if Pluto is somehow involved. If Mars has only good aspects, then the family will have tensions but their debates will lead to constructive decisions, even if with a lot of temperament involved.\nSuch people are also developing strong urges to protect their family. In case that a member of it is threatened, they will get outraged and release enormous amounts of fury towards the possible threat. A general advice to whoever has experienced a harsh Martian energy in his childhood is to try to smooth it by getting involved in athletic activities. It will be a pity if the same type of energy which harmed you while young, will harm your own offspring too. Understand that this cycle should be closed or at least softened or else the pattern will continue towards the generations to come. \n \n\n\nOne of the good things this natal placement grants to the native, is a very active and healthy old age. Mars placed there gives a robust body that refuses to age, and the person will be working out to keep it in good shape for long. \n \n\n\nPeople who have Mars in the fourth house can have problems concerning real estate matters, while also can suffer injuries and have all types of accidents in their home surroundings. If you have this aspect, be very careful how you handle all objects ruled by Mars in your house. Take extreme care while using sharp knifes during cooking and while operating machinery that cuts things such as electric saws. Strangely enough, this placement gives the possibility of experiencing a fire at home, or elsehow being involved with setting fire to a building. \n \n\n\nOn the positive side, the person will feel tremendous amounts of power rising inside him, mostly connected with his roots. He might be very proud of the family’s legacy, and will use this pride for reaching his goals. He has very strong survival abilities, and will be able to fight his way out in the biggest difficulties. In addition, the impulsive energy of Mars can give a quick creation of a family and makes the native rush into decisions of making children.\nIn case you have this natal placement with hard aspects, seeing a psychologist might only help you in handling the anger issues that your childhood years can bring. In case that you learn to channel the Martian energy towards positive activities, this aspect will grant you with an active life and your – so important for you- family legacy will continue and make you proud.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:21:29'),
(1638, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-3rd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving the impulsive planet Mars in the third house has a strong impact on the native’s mind and ways of communication. Such people have very active minds that can even become aggressive. They like to argue and debate and receive pleasure in verbally defeating other people.\nWhen someone has Mars in the third house, his speech can be offensive, and will frequently hurt people with what they say. Even their humor can be sarcastic and provocative, while they also tend to speak without beforehand thinking the consequences of what they say. Even when realizing they are wrong, they do not confess it and prefer to defend their first opinion with every way possible. It does not take a lot of effort to make them nervous; Mars in the house of communications has a special button that can easily trigger a furious response. \n \n\n\nMars in the 3rd house gives a lot of fighting with siblings, which is mostly frequent in their childhood. The quarreling nature of the red planet has such an effect on neighbors too; it will frequently bring tension in the native’s nearby surroundings and raise the tone of the voices. The curious fact is that many times the native is the bad neighbor, and not the other person! When Mars is adversely afflicted, then the chart owner will be deliberately seeking trouble, just for the sake of arguing. This is a rather unhealthy behavior, which creates an overall bad atmosphere for his everyday life and should be definitely kept under control. When Mars is left untamed in his bad traits, he can become really malicious, mirroring back to you the evil that you unleash.\nTheir childhood years were probably rather difficult, and their school and neighborhood were not peaceful. As children, they have usually suffered bullying and also been victims of it. The area of their childhood residence is usually a violent and unsafe one, with raging criminality. The constant subconscious fear of their neighborhood creates their alertness towards external threats, as a way to survive and feel safer in this dangerous environment.\nThe native with such a placement will frequently go to short journeys; their nature though will be rather impulsive and forced. They can have a violent hobby such as hunting or some martial art, connected with these nearby excursions. Mars in the 3rd house creates a hyper-energetic person, who feels rather restless and does not know how to release the abundance of mental energy. Their hasty way of thought can lead to a lot of quick wrong decisions, so such natives are advised to invest in developing a more analytical thought. Learning how to wait before taking a decision or speaking will calm down the explosive energies of Mars and help the individual structure his reality in a better way; such an approach might even teach him how precious a peaceful atmosphere can be in their daily reality. This is the way of healing the traumas that keep the mind alert, reducing the subconscious stress that is dominating their everyday life. \n \n\n\nOf course, such type of a mind can be useful for a lot of professions. Every job that needs an aggressive speech will be successful. The only issue is that most of these jobs have a very flexible morality; the native would excel as a political agitator, in propaganda and spreading rumors, as a low-ranked military responsible for educating neophytes by oppressing them and breaking down their defenses and character into pieces. Every job that is based on verbal violence and arguments can go well, but we firmly advise all natives with this placement to not indulge in unleashing uncontrolled Martian powers onto others. When Mars is allowed to function at will, he can create a fanatic, a sadist and someone who enjoys getting into situations of ecstatic frenzy.\nThe third house is ruling everything that is crafted by hands, and the presence of Mars can create a great blacksmith, weapon creator, knife handler or surgeon. Especially when Mars is only positively aspected by other planets, the person is advised to enter into such kind of Martian professions that involve metal and sharp objects, as his mastery can reach unique levels and he can offer a great service to the humanity.\nA last advice for all our friends who have Mars in their 3rd house! Do not drive fast. Especially if you are driving a motorcycle. We all know that the third house is ruling transportation, so when Mars is present in the house and adversely aspected there are extreme dangers of accidents. Be even more careful if Mars is afflicted by Uranus, or Uranus is also present in the house. The safety of your body should be of your first priorities and you really do not need to be cocky and show off yourself with your new motorcycle. Be patient; increasing your speed while driving will probably shorten your trip by ten minutes, but why to risk arriving in pieces or not arriving at all?\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written! \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:21:35');

(1639, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-2nd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen Mars, the red planet, is located in the second house of a natal chart, its impact mostly affects the life areas that are connected to money and possessions. Mars might be considered a malefic, and indeed functions like that if poor by placement in a sign or adversely aspected; yet if it is strong by position and well-aspected can bring a lot of wealth to the native- through hard work and a lot of effort of course. Such people are usually overly materialistic, measuring their own success and self-confidence by their belongings.\nMars is one of the most impulsive planets, and gets irritated when pressured. The individuals that have their Mars placed in the second house prefer to have their own business and actively create their money, as they do not like to work for someone else who will keep the biggest part of the gains for himself. They are hard workers; their profession is a battlefield where they want to be by any means victorious. Financial gain is for them the loots gained through this battle, and spending them is their celebration dance after the victory. As in any war, the spoils gained are not to be shared with others even if they fought together; problems can appear between them and co-workers in sharing the gains. The native’s money is spent rather quickly; Mars in the second house creates a person that usually buys things hastily.\nFor a man with such a placement, possessions are closely connected with his masculinity. The more he has, the more man he feels. In a woman horoscope this aspect is mostly connected with feelings of security rather than proof of being strong and raising self-confidence. A woman with such an aspect might be a lot more interested in possessing other people, especially people that are big spenders, athletic or have some type of power over the masses. They are attracted towards military men, and if Mars in the second forms an aspect with a vital planet in the seventh house a marriage with a military person is probable. The same applies if Aries is on the cusp of the 7th house, or Mars aspects the ruling planet of the 7th house. \n \n\n\nThe material goods acquired by the person who has such a placement are a fetish that they do not like to share with other people. They do not like lending their personal stuff, are possessive and adore admiring their belongings. Sometimes, they do not use their belongings themselves in order not to damage them or make them wear up. For them, what they own is a symbolical collection of moments, each material thing has also the value of the time and effort spent so that they manage to acquire it. Their impatience makes them want to gain quickly the objects they desire, so their morality can become rather flexible if the right opportunity occurs. \n \n\n\nAnother category of objects that a second house Mars adores, are weapons. These can become also objects of fetish, either through just being decorations for his walls or by using them as a hobby.  A person with such a placement might invest his money in real weapons, replicas, or even collections of war memorabilia. The native should be always careful with the local laws; having a real weapon in his house without the necessary paperwork might not end up well. \n \n\n\nIf Mars is heavily aspected by Neptune, Mercury or Pluto, there are possibilities of using non-honest ways of acquiring things. This could be by stealing, swindling or even violence, depending on the aspects and the conditions of the other planets involved in this placement. The individual might spend a lot of money on sports, either by watching them or gambling on them. The second will definitely appear if his Mars aspects some planet located in his 5th house or is otherwise somehow connected with the house.\nIf Mars is adversely aspected by other planets, it can also indicate loss of wealth during difficult transits. This can happen through unexpected expenses, robbery, or debt payback if there exists an opposition with some planet located in the 8th house. The individuals that have such an opposition, should keep away from receiving loans, because payback will be utterly difficult and will bring a lot of problems.\nThe best way to soften this placement of Mars is to engage in athletic activities. Also, trying to share your possessions and offer to other people will blunt any difficult aspects that your natal chart might have. When you allow the cumulated Martian energy to explode in controlled ways, there is less risk to harm others, and your Mars will function better, bringing you more gains. Keeping an egoistic attitude will just feed this explosive time-bomb you carry; the result will be a major uncontrolled explosion in some random moment. Try to disconnect your feelings of security from your material possessions, simulate for yourself a different environment to learn acting in different situations than the ones you try to force upon your reality, and it is guaranteed that you will live a lot more happily and appreciate what you gain. Even if you do not change your attitude towards your possessions, as this reaction is probably created in your early childhood where material things and their ownership were quite misbalanced in your perception.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:21:39'),
(1640, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-1st-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nMars is the traditional ruling planet of the first house, because the house is associated with the first sign of the zodiac, Aries. Representing life-force, activity and the struggle to survive and conquer, Mars is creating a highly energetic and dynamic personality when located in the house of self. This is a great position for the red planet to reside in, even if the abundance of energy can lead to aggressive behaviors and other trouble caused by rash.\nThe native yearns for independence and is quite straightforward. Life is always a battle, and for planet Mars there is no other outcome than victory. Individuals with such an aspect are spontaneous, which can lead to difficulties due to inconsideration of all the parameters of situations that appear. It is a common phenomenon for such natives to get into fights due to their explosive temperament; yet, they usually are the ones to win because Mars tends to give an athletic and strong body. It is also very common that the native is into martial arts or other sports activities that furthermore empower his carnal self. The best advice for handling well this powerful planet is to tame these eruptive energies and channel them into healthy activities to get the best out of Mars’s force.\nThe first house rules the head and the face, so there is a possibility of having cuts or burns on it that might leave a scar. It is many times easy to distinguish a person that has Mars in the first, from marks on his face. Such types of people are also prominent to high fevers when they are sick, especially if Mars has some adverse aspects to other planets with an effect on the body such as the Sun. Also, a first house Mars person must guard against accidents, especially those that can happen because of his impulsiveness and enormous self-confidence. Daring without taking precautions and considering the risks might usually end up in lucky results, but it is the one time when luck will not work that is enough for a catastrophic situation to happen. Be careful when using machinery, weapons, knives, tools, and everything that is somehow connected to Mars and Aries. \n \n\n\nBoredom is maybe the worse feeling that a first house Mars person can experience; if the surroundings are not interesting enough to fill them with enthusiasm, such a native will end up a boiling casserole- and the best thing of course is to change surroundings. Feelings of frustration will frequently appear when they do not have something to do; Mars needs to keep himself occupied with something and laziness is not an option. Even when they are procrastinating with their obligations, they don’t just spend some lazy time but rather invest their time to other activities they indeed find interesting. For sure, they can accomplish in one day a lot more than the rest of the people. Nevertheless, they must consciously choose to not become overly dominating towards other people, if they wish to be in harmony with the rest of the world. This is because most other individuals have a slower pace, and it should definitely be respected; the world cannot just adapt to their hasty approach of reality. \n \n\n\nEven if Mars in the first house might make the native prone to surgeries, their recuperative powers are very strong and they heal very quickly. They have a higher chance of fracture their bones and other injuries than any other placement could give; a reason for this happening is also that they are physically more active than anyone. A couch potato has definitely less possibilities to suffer an accident, than a person who is involved in extreme sports. Usually, their athletic abilities and strong body last long years, granting them an active old age. \n \n\n\nMars in the first house gives a pioneer; there is a strong urge to discover life and people who have this natal position ignore the wisdom and advice of elder people.  If Mars is aspected with square, opposition or sometimes conjunction by Pluto, Saturn and Uranus, the native will develop self-destructive behaviors, many times because they even feel that even their own self is a jail for their freedom. Women with Mars positioned there can have quite a lot of male characteristics and succeed in traditionally masculine jobs. If their Mars is afflicting Venus or/and Uranus, their masculine traits might also affect their sexuality, either by preferring women or by being the dominant person in their relationships with men. Similar sexual preferences can occur with men having Mars afflicted in the first house, but no matter which gender they prefer, they like to keep the power of dominance for themselves. \n \n\n\nOverall, Mars situated in the house of the self is quite a positive natal placement. In case that the planet is only positively aspected, there is absolutely nothing to worry; other natives would envy you for this gift as you will be able to accomplish a lot more things both in your everyday reality and in your life as a whole. The only enemy you have is your own self, and your heightened self-confidence that might lead you acting without thinking. Taming your Mars is not the easiest thing, as the planet actually does not allow to be tamed. Nevertheless, chanelling its energy can easily make it co-operate with you, and physical activity (with all precautions of safety) is the best option. A last hint that might change the functionality of the planet in your chart: Do not try to be the Alpha male, even if this would naturally happen in case of personality combats. You might end up easily to be an Alpha male, but there might not be any other males left in the pack. And then, starts boredom, which is a worse enemy for a first house Mars than sharing power with others.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:22:05'),
(1641, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-11th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen Mars is in the 11th house, the house of friendships, groups and organizations, the native dedicates a lot of energy and effort towards empowering and maintaining his position in society. His public image is of great importance, and he strives to become a center of attention. \n \n\n\nMars in the 11th house can be a double-sided knife; when well aspected it can grant great leadership abilities. On the contrary, when hard aspects apply on the planet, his friendships and unions with groups can be quite competitive and destructive, becoming a thorn in the native’s soul instead of being a road of self-development. \n \n\n\nThe native usually strives to form groups so that he achieves his personal goals, and enlarges his cycle frequently without caring to nurture previous friendships. His approach towards obtaining new friends is rather aggressive and competitive, often battling with them on Alpha Male roles. He might join sports organizations or military-centered clubs, seek friends through hobbies that involve physical activity or that have something to do with weapons. When natal Mars has a difficult aspect (square, opposition and sometimes conjunction) with Jupiter, the amount of friends and acquaintances tends to get out of control, creating problems of sentimental instability to the native. Everyone seems to be a friend, but the real ones are either none or just a few. Even in the latter, he most probably does not recognize them, as he mostly dedicates time to the most physically active friends than to the ones who have him more dearly in their hearts.\nEven if the native enjoys groups, he cannot be called a team-player, and diminishing his egoism would be one of the best ways of self-development and spiritual progress. When the native understands that cooperation is necessary for the fulfillment of his own ambitions, the positive traits of Mars will be triggered and the planet will start to function more harmonically. Also, fanaticism should be by all means avoided; Mars in the 11th can frequently drive the native to become part of groups that are hatred-based and which will furthermore debilitate the functions of Mars in his natal chart.\nBecoming a part of such groups might be an outcome of a difficult childhood, where the native was frequently bullied by other children and tries to regain confidence and meaning in friendships. Unfortunately, sometimes he tends to react the same way that he was treated, spreading the same pattern to other people. Bullying and physical molest in childhood are mostly present in people that have Pluto, Uranus or Saturn square natal Mars. In case that Mars is positioned in Scorpio, there could be also sexual abuse of some type.\nGenerally, people with Mars in the 11th house are very passionate, searching for active people as friends and trying to dedicate a lot of time in activities that involve some type of movement. They get bored quite easily, and if the friend does not have the spark of action inside him, they quite easily abandon him. They are definitely not submissive types, which actually makes a lot of friendships pass awkward phases of competitiveness, as they are not attracted to passive types of people. There exist frequent power games with friends, and being the center of the group really matters to them. They can only allow people that they genuinely admire to be center of their groups, instead of them. If they do not like the person that is the center of the group, they either leave or try to gain his position, sometimes using mischievous means to obtain it.\nTheir friends are usually having strong Aries/Mars characteristics in their natal chart, and quarreling with them is rather frequent – even if it is lighthearted and for fun. They tend to be impatient, and receive great satisfaction in being admired and lead. When they are lost in the crowd, though, they get frustrated and can easily erupt. They do not like governmental rules, nor being patient in situations as standing in lines. If Mars is aspecting Uranus, they tend to join anarchistic or other revolutionary groups, and generally get involved in riots and other types of actions that bring disorder. \n \n\n\nIn case that Mars is only positively aspected by other planets, the native will rise in power in his group and become a head of it. The nature of the group is usually determined by the sign where the 11th house cusp is located, and if it is Aquarius it usually involves some kind of political agitation towards revolt. If in Scorpio, then there is high probability of being part of a secret society, often having either money, magic or sex involved. If the cusp falls in Aries, then the organization is either of military or of athletic purposes, while when the cusp lies in Leo or Pisces, theatre and artistic performances could be the concept.\nAnother thing that the native with such a placement should be careful of, is possible oppositions of Mars in the 11th to planets in the 5th house. If such an opposition exists, then there is high possibility of difficulties between love and friendships. They either tend to fall in love with friends, or to lose their loves because of friends. It is quite likely that some friend of them gets in an affair with his significant other, which of course afterwards makes Mars in the 11th explode its aggression with all the consequences that this could have. A third issue that could appear is to have to choose between love and friends, as there might exist situations where these two sections of life cannot function together at the same time.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:22:11'),
(1642, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-5th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nThose born with natal Mars in the 5th House are blessed to live a life full of activity. As the fifth house rules everything that is recreational, fun and promotes self-expression, Mars makes the native dedicate his energy towards affairs ruled by this placement. With the 5th house traditionally ruled by Leo, Mars finds a positive fiery surrounding to express and feels quite at home. This placement is rather positive, and if supported by beneficial aspects can lead to a very vivid and joyful life. \n \n\n\nThe 5th house involves everything linked to playing, should it be flirting, being involved in physical recreational activities, gaming or even gambling. The red planet placed there influences all types of pleasure and indulgence, offering to the native a playful reality. Fun is something very important in their lives, and they strive to engage in activities with friends, being usually the ones in the center of them. The strong competitive spirit usually makes such natives bad loser, but even then the procedure of the game is what matters for them the most. Such kind of people are great for becoming sports coaches and working with children athletics, and can easily become a role model for them. Leading an active lifestyle is something very important for them, and outdoor activities in the nature are pretty common. These people cannot just close themselves in 4 walls; Mars needs freedom and does not accepts being captured in a stable reality. \n \n\n\nAs the fifth house is also connected with love, Mars placed there would make the native approach his sympathy without shame. Indeed, they tend to make the first step, and numerous love affairs is a common pattern to be observed. Mars loves to conquer, and he does not easily accept losing in this particular game. Multiple partners, sudden attachments and breakdowns are frequent to appear, and this could lead to the natural outcome of breaking lover’s hearts and emotions. Mars needs to socialize, to conquer more and more, and does not feel well when everything is programmed and stable. Such kind of people are enjoying the struggle of obtaining something new; they see that as a game and sometimes cannot even realize that this could lead dear people around them to disappointment. \n \n\n\nMars here is beneficial for having children, and the most probable is that the first child will be a boy. If not, then it will either have a lot of Aries/Martian characteristics, or will be hyperactive and behave like a male. In any situation, the child will copy the parent’s approach towards life, fun and physical activities, and become a very active person itself. The native should be very careful to be soft and tender in his approach towards the child. Mars is usually bringing strict discipline, and the parent should always keep in mind to not exercise physical or psychological violence on the child. Both the child and the parent should exercise sports or hobbies, to channel the possible aggressive behaviors into constructive activities. \n \n\n\nThis placement makes the person highly creative, investing a lot of his energy in his hobbies. Hobbies tend to become their personal way of meditation and of expelling superfluous energy. Taking risks makes their adrenaline and serotonins flow strong, even if this can also lead to the natural consequences of losing. Gambling is a beloved activity for a 5th house Martian, but in case there are negative aspects with malefics big losses are indicated. Having a difficult aspect with Neptune can make the native combine gambling with alcohol or other substances; of course the most possible outcomes in such situations are disappointments both for them and the people around them. Nevertheless, if there exists a trine with Jupiter or Venus, the native has high possibilities of earning through such games. The same applies when Uranus is in positive aspect, but in such an occasion the gain would come unexpectedly and not through regular gambling.\nPeople with Mars in the 5th house can excel in theatre; most times this will not be something professional but rather exercised as a hobby. They can join amateur artistic clubs, but usually their need for competition brings tensions and they can frequently change groups. They tend to also use melodrama in their personal life, which can sometimes be funny but also turn hurtful for their dear people. They like to show off their abilities and adore getting attention; of course this could even ridicule them if their abilities have not reach a respectable level.\nA person with this placement should be careful not to explode his suppressed anger onto dear people, especially in situations when he feels losing in some competitive action, or that control is out of his hands. Softening can occur when the positive qualities of Mars are used for channeling the aggression. The person must realize that egoism is his primal enemy, and that by controlling it he can actually enhance the quality of his recreational time. The people around him would feel fair-treated, and enjoy in such activities; else it is probable that the native will be not followed by them into games and fun.\nIf natal Mars is very close to the 5th house cusp, and in very difficult aspects to Uranus or Pluto, the native can have suffered child abuse. In such a situation he should be very cautious that this pattern does not occur towards his own child, because it is hidden deeply in his subconscious and can appear as an uncontrolled motive. The native will be striving to give love to his child, but not understanding that his eruptions can create an unhealthy environment to it. When the aspects involve Neptune, the native can even not remember his acts or words of violence. This can happen both by being under influence of alcohol and other substances, or by neurotic subconscious outbursts that afterwards are buried into the depths of the mind rapidly.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:22:18'),
(1643, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-10th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nMars is the planet of force, the masculine drive of moving forward and battling your way through surroundings. Therefore, located in the 10th house which is responsible for one’s establishment and reputation, it affects everything associated with the individual’s social image. Professional roles and their fulfilments, career orientation and honor are just some of the subjects that are ruled by the 10th house in a person’s life. Also, it represents authority figures and thus, anything that has to do with governmental services is depicted in it. The dominant parent can be observed through the 10th house condition, as he has been leading the native as a role model in the first steps of his life. In general both people and organizations that have power over a person, and the way that he exercises it on others are shown in this celestial area of the chart.\nHaving Mars in this house gives a life orientated about personal success and achievements in one’s career. Nevertheless, it by no means grants success by itself. Mars as a personal planet shows the direction towards which effort is being made; it is the aspects with other planets that shows whether success is to be reached or the efforts will be mostly in vain. The condition of generational planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) and their aspects to Mars have a big role, for they are the ones opening the gates to successful recognition from the masses.\nMars in the 10th house drives the native to fight and struggle for respect through all of his life. This, along with the martial characteristic of the planet, can guide someone to choose a military career. Indeed, this placement can make a native strive to recognition through raising his rank, which can also appear to many people that have Aries on the cusp of their 10th house and important celestial bodies inside. If Mars is not aspected well, it can bring disputes with other military staff and unhealthy competition. One should be very careful not to indulge in behind-the-scenes activities in his working place, as there is high possibility of being discovered and disgraced.\nOn the other hand, the raw energy that the planet enforces on 10th house matters gives a lot of enthusiasm to the native, strengthening his will to fulfil his goals. In a woman’s horoscope it can bring a manly approach to career matters, making her more powerful than men in her surroundings in promoting ideas and enforcing decisions. The person has the need to do the things his own way, granting strong feelings of success when his ideas are implemented. On the other hand, failure is for him a sharp knife that when occurs is hurting him more than it would any other average person. Failures can have aggression as an effect, a pattern which is highly likely to have passed from the dominant parent, especially if Mars is poorly afflicted. It makes the individual prone to resign from his profession if his honor is at stake, or if he takes some failure very personally. \n \n\n\nAs Mars is ruling physical power, athletics as a profession strongly connected with it. Mars also is the ruler of all jobs with uniforms, thus being responsible for careers in the police and for doctors, especially those who are of chirurgical background. We should not forget that knifes, sharp instruments, and generally everything involving metal, its use and its transformation are under the influence of the red planet. A lot of important surgeons have Mars in this house. The presence of Scorpio on the house’s cusp, or adverse aspects from Pluto to Mars can create a person who actually takes pleasure from using knifes, even from inflicting pain to others. This does not mean though that he would not be a good professional. The adverse aspects show conflicts and emotional separation from the dominant parent in the young ages, and can manifest accordingly in his vocation. Mars being in Taurus or Libra is an indicator of moral scandal, and natives with this placement should concentrate in keeping their ethics and strategies clean in their profession. \n \n\n\nAll these apply even stronger when Mars is near the Midheaven; then power can become an obsession. Sometimes it is wiser for the native to work alone and not in a group, in order to avoid conflicts and aggression. Another pattern that is frequently observed, is that the placement can bring success in quite young years, which is indeed common in careers like the military or sports. A negative impact that Mars frequently has when in the 10th is few good human relations with people, mostly because the native himself tries to dominate his surroundings and is prone to be competitive.\nThe most problematic aspects that can occur are squares, oppositions and conjunctions with Saturn, Uranus or Pluto. People with such kind of placements can have problems with the government, troubles through their aggression and violent behavior, and should exercise techniques of reducing their anger and channel it elsewhere. By strengthening the difficult natal positions with handling their violent outbreaks, they can harmonize all 10th house issues and also heal the remnants of conflicts with their parent. \n \n\n\nIn sports, this position can signify the athlete that is not a team player, influencing adversely his acceptance from others even if he is in physical terms better than them. The lesson needed is to understand that unless he harmonizes his activity with the rest of the team, the difficult aspects that might exist will be triggered, leading to a lack of balance in other fields of his life too. The native has a strong urge to show off his body and physical abilities, and should be careful not to overdo that. On the other hand, Mars there indeed gives good body characteristics and performances, especially when the Ascendant falls in Aries. \n \n\n\nUnder no circumstances should such a native exercise physical abuse towards his family members. He might have experienced it himself and have it as a normal recorded way of acting in his mind’s patterns, but this is his chance of stopping the loop. In case he succeeds to push his aggressiveness towards constructive actions, the rewards from life will be generous. And for him, they would matter even more, because they would be highly connected with 10th house issues, exactly the ones that he is all his life striving for.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:22:24'),
(1644, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-12th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen natal Jupiter is in the 12th house of a natal chart, its beneficial rays guarantee protection and generally soften most difficult traits that the house represents in the native’s life.\nThe 12th house is ruled by Pisces and planet Neptune, and is strongly connected with places of restriction. Jupiter here may bring some type of involvement with institutions such as monasteries, hospitals and prisons. This placement makes the native a very compassionate person, willing to offer his services in order to comfort others. The presence of Jupiter here gifts a great intuition and a thirst to expand in the fields of psychology and healing.\nAs the twelfth house is responsible for both the collective subconscious and the individual’s deeper layers, Jupiter here will expand knowledge and will need less effort to understand the hidden functions of the human mind. A person with such a placement can even get deep into metaphysical studies, while the benefic planet grants protection from malicious supernatural attacks and accidents during roaming the inner fields of minds or the outer areas of reality. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, Jupiter in the house of secrets might bring up some issues, as the planet’s expansive nature may create difficulties in keeping secrets, both the native’s own and of other people. In case that Jupiter is adversely aspected with Mercury, the individual should really be careful to think before revealing sensitive information, as he can hurt others or create misunderstandings.\nGenerally, Jupiter placed in this rather difficult house can be of great aid against all types of unexpected difficulties. Jupiter will protect from hidden enemies, and actually even make them change their approach towards the individual. The planet will not only shield the native but also can make the enemies realize the wrongness of their actions, and bring honest apologies towards the chart owner. Such events can afterwards create great friends, even if this procedure of making your foe a friend can feel rather awkward.\nNatal Jupiter in the 12th house can many times signify that the chart owner hides his religious or philosophical beliefs. He might have been brought up in a family that does not really accept the child’s road to spirituality, and so the young native develops his beliefs away from other people’s eyes. Alternatively, the native can be living in a cultural surrounding that does not tolerate differences in beliefs, and can even be pretending to follow a different religion just so that the people who surround him do not mistreat him.\nThis natal position of Jupiter by house can bring quite a lot of paranormal events, mostly of an uncontrolled nature. Of course, the benefic energy that planet Jupiter bears will mostly bring positive outcomes from such bizarre situations. The combination of Neptunian and Jupiterian energies can even create miracles, materialization of prayer and other profound and life-changing spiritual experiences. \n \n\n\nMany of these experiences will manifest while the person chooses to live periods of solitude and meditate, and he should be careful of whom to reveal them to. There are quite a lot of possibilities that he will not be believed by others. In addition, the Neptunian traits of the house will make such events strictly subjective, passing certain meanings that can only apply to the life of the native. This will make such events barely understandable to other individuals. \n \n\n\nSuch a placement will make the person be an altruist and a dreamer, frequently indulging in visions of utopian societies where personal benefit does not matter. No matter how wonderful such ideas sound, the native with such a placement is advised to always keep one foot on the ground. His philosophical approach of universal love may be theoretically correct, but it is always better to keep a trace of common reality. In fact, a stable basis on reality can be of great aid to expand towards alternative realities; the best way to jump to the skies is to have stable ground under you.\nWhen Jupiter is residing in the 12th house, the individual should be careful to not allow the planet expand any possible “martyr syndromes” that can dwell deep in his mind. His self-sacrifice tendencies for others can often help other people, but it would be quite wrong to constantly create similar situations, just to feel being of use. In the end, this can lead to being taken advantage of, or elsehow self-destruct – even if Jupiter is well-aspected.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:22:36'),

The beneficial energy of the grand benefic illuminates all matters connected with the house, bringing luck and prosperity through for the native through other people that he regards as near and dear. \n \n\n\nThe native’s friends are rather loud and with a great sense of humor, and will frequent organize events of a very positive atmosphere. These may involve a lot of eating and drinking, while also deep philosophical conversations as Jupiter is the traditional ruler of the 9th house and higher meanings. Jupiter will bring quite a lot of happiness in being surrounded by people even if adversely aspected. Difficult squares or oppositions mostly signify problems of having too many acquaintances and friends, and indulging too much in group activities, which can make the individual tired or dedicate less times to other matters of his life.\nThis natal placement of Jupiter can bring great success through working in groups, as it promotes harmony and good collaboration. The native can even become a good leader in such organizations, especially if Jupiter is well-aspected by the Sun or Pluto. An 11th house Jupiter promotes all humanitarian causes, as the planet’s energy blends with the Aquarian nature of the house. This can bring great success in all organizations concerning aid to the humankind. In addition, other possible central interest of such groups may be education, social structure or even religion and the law. \n \n\n\nAs Jupiter is also ruling foreign lands, its natal placement in the eleventh house may indicate a lot of friends from abroad. Usually, conversations with them involve a mutual sharing of cultural traditions, thoughts on different religions while also exchange of ideas concerning traveling.\nThe 11th house is also considered a house that rules money, but not in a constant or direct way such as the 2nd and the 8th do. The 11th house is mostly responsible of a big fortune, the wealth of your dreams that can appear in one’s reality once in a lifetime. Jupiter placed here is the best natal aspect someone can have for such a celestial gift, and there will be probably some friend’s help involved in achieving it. In case you have an eleventh house Jupiter, examine whether you have the cusps of the 2nd or 8th house placed in Sagittarius; if yes then you have even more possibilities of observing such a pattern happen in your life.\nJupiter gives quite faithful friends; a person with such a placement is lucky enough to have a lot of support during all life periods. He will literally never be alone during his trouble and there can be numerous people fighting side by side his personal battles. This is a direct influence on his own attitude towards his friends; the individual invests a lot of time and care towards the people he considers important.\nAn individual with his Jupiter in the eleventh house is a natural organizer, having strong abilities in planning large events and activities. Such people may excel in jobs connected with the masses, no matter if it is concert planning, political campaign management, demonstration organization or anything else that involves large amounts of participants.\nIf you have this placement, lay back and enjoy. You probably will have a lot more easy-flowing life than many other individuals, as your problems may be frequently solved by other people – without even you requesting it. Even the hard periods of your life will be of a rather soft nature, as the care and love of your friends will heal most traumas quickly. Just keep in mind to not over-expand in friend matters.\nIndeed, maybe most people you meet are of the highest quality; yet it may be physically impossible to interact actively with an enormous amount of people. You can get in unwanted situations of forgetting the most important ones, just because of your tendency to always create more and more friends. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:22:40'),
(1646, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-10th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWith natal Jupiter in the 10th house, a native is blessed with the gift of luck in all his career matters. In addition, such a natal aspect is great for one’s public image, as it creates a fairly liked persona by the coworkers, the employees and the masses. \n \n\n\nThe 10th house is ruled by Capricorn and Saturn, having as a result the blending of Jupiter’s expansive nature with the thorough strategic abilities that Saturn can provide. Capricorn is usually signifying effort and hard work; yet, the grand benefic’s presence here is giving a more relaxed approach to the native’s career. He can win without trying too hard, as most things based on luck or external parameters will magically have positive outcomes.\nJupiter in the 10th signifies a successful father who is a role model for the young native and passes his knowledge and experience through valuable lessons. During the native’s young years, the father may have a lot of successes, giving to the child reasons to celebrate. The native observes the professional growth of the father, and the pleasure that he sees in his parent’s face becomes a motivation to achieve same things later in his life. In addition, the father has a very good reputation and is widely respected; this also later becomes a goal for the child to reach.\nThe individual with such a natal placement will follow exactly the same patter, creating a good reputation and being helped by authority figures to rise in power and prosper. He will be aided both by powerful businessmen and judges, and will have a rather good connection with the established religion and its priests. His activities may involve charities through religion or other ways of donating, which will furthermore improve the way that other people perceive him.\nJupiter in the tenth gives good abilities of leadership; on the other hand when such an individual receives a leading position he might indulge in procrastination. Especially an ill-aspected Jupiter will definitely contribute in capturing a prominent seat in some governmental or private company, and setting as a goal to work as less as possible. Jupiter in this natal placement can create the Golden Boy stereotype, waiting to cash in monthly checks full of bonuses for actually doing barely anything. \n \n\n\nIf the benefic planet is well aspected, then the individual will have excellent business ethics, and his generous and shining character will be just enough for his job. Career opportunities will arise just by his presence and people will strive to pull him into their business, as they feel an inner need to make him involved in their plans. A strong effect on such decisions can have his very good sense of humor which can blend greatly with serious business conversations and make him highly liked.\nPublicity can be gained easily and by luck, while Jupiter will guarantee that the native is chosen for promotion among a lot of others. The planet functions as a hook hanging from the heavens; even if the person does not target rising high in the structure and hierarchy of the company he works, life will still pull him up. Sometimes, this exact fact can even be the reason; the native is not obsessed with rising in higher positions and thus he is picked due to his wisdom and lack of pressure about such matters.\nAnother blessing that Jupiter grants when in the tenth, is actually choosing the career that suits you. A lot of people are forced to follow a different occupation than their dream job, but tenth house Jupiter individuals are not in this category! Keep in mind that such an attitude may take some time to get triggered and the native can actually understand what he really wants to do after his 30th birthday. Until that moment, Jupiter placed there can even grant him a rather relaxed life, as his family usually will have enough money. Instead, the native may travel some years to understand the world, concentrate on long-term studying and receive degrees and diplomas, without rushing to get into the working system. \n \n\n\nIf you have such a placement, there are really few things we can advise you. Just keep in mind to not over-do it with your self-confidence; Jupiter brings most of the times luck but it is the one time he does not, that he will screw you up! It is ok to risk some times, but if you risk all times it is definite that at least once you will fall. But, of course, Jupiter will help you rise again!\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:22:45'),
(1647, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-6th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nAs Jupiter is widely known to be the most benefic planet, its natal placement in the 6th house is a blessing for the native’s job matters. In addition, this is probably the best aspect for health; Jupiter is a shield against health problems and can give an great vitality. \n \n\n\nPeople who have their natal Jupiter in the 6th house actually love to work. Through working, they gain deep satisfaction and gratify themselves; it is their way of philosophical evolution. For them, it is very easy to find a new job and Jupiter usually gives a lot of them. Such a native will not be left unemployed for long; when he applies for a new position he will be granted it earlier than all the rest. Actually, the reason of him changing jobs might be only to find something better or to try experiencing a new position or work type.\nHe is a well-qualified and hard worker, which is noticed by his colleagues. They usually love him, as he has an exceptional work ethic system, by embracing the coworkers, helping them, teaching them and being fair to everyone. The managers always like him too because of his honesty and dedication. The result is that he becomes the bond between groups of people and a source of inspiration for everyone. Managers will strive to keep him in the company, as he is an example for the rest workers. \n \n\n\nIn his personal life, Jupiter’s placement in the 6th indicates a fondness of volunteering and altruistic offer towards the society. Such a person will frequently be associated with volunteering actions or communities, selflessly offering to others his time and care. He can himself be involved as a healer both of the mind and the body. If the native is a doctor, he might join the “Doctors without borders” or a similar organization. This placement is great for work as a medical, as the 6th house is also associated with asteroid Chiron and is responsible about health. As Jupiter is the ruler of the 9th house, there are possibilities of the native working abroad. This is not the general rule, but if Jupiter is supported by a trine from the 9th house then it is rather sure to happen.\nThe 6th house is also ruling the individual’s health and Jupiter acts protectively when placed inside. The native will be very healthy and energetic; nevertheless hard afflictions of Jupiter from Saturn or some other malefic can create problems that even a prominent Jupiter cannot protect from. As it is considered to be the planet of expansion, the health issues to whom it is connected involve the pattern of “too much of something”. Thus, any possible problems involve too much sugar in the blood, too much growth of cancer cells and so on. If you have this placement, such types of medical analyzes are a very good option every once and a while. Do not be afraid, though, it really takes to have very hard aspects so that Jupiter creates health problems. Your health will be probably very good during all your life, and will be a constant source of satisfaction.\nThe 6th house is not only ruling the native’s services to others, but also his own servants. With such a wonderful aspect, an individual will be always helped by others and treated well – you could even say that the karma that he creates from being of service returns back to him instantly. \n \n\n\nIn addition, Jupiter placed in the sixth house will give great joy through small animals; the native might have even a lot of pets in his house. Breeding animals as a job is also very favored, Jupiter will make this business prosper and the native highly satisfied with the career that he chose.\nThere are few things one can advice a person with such a positive 6th house aspect.

In this case, as the 5th house is connected with joy, children, love and sex, Jupiter’s presence will bring a great amount of happiness through everything that falls in this category.\nThe Grand Benefic can bring a lot of children, with the first of them having a rather strong Sagittarius/Jupiter emphasis in its natal chart. The native is very fond of children and will show a great deal of love towards them, also receiving a lot of affection back. He will adore playing with them and they really like his funny and warm character. Usually, the native as a parent figure will educate his children well, providing them also high philosophic views on ethics and morals, religion and the law. The children will develop a just and fair character, inspired by the native’s own example.\nJupiter in the fifth house expands the native’s creativity. Generally, if Jupiter is alone in the house, there might be a lot of procrastination and he will never become a great artists. If there are other planets also present, or Jupiter is receiving very positive aspects from Venus, Neptune or Uranus, he will be a lot more productive and invest his time in developing his self-expression into art. In case that the Sun or the Moon support Jupiter, there are possibilities of fame coming his way.\nFun is a very important priority in such a person’s life. Jupiter will give him a strong sense of humor, and draws him towards recreational activities that promote joy. This could be literally anything, from partying to sports, from gathering friends to visiting movies; everything that brings joy and laughter will play a strong role in his reality.\nJupiter in the 5th also likes gambling, and indeed can bring gains; especially if he is well-aspected. Good aspects for gambling are sextiles and trines to Venus and Uranus, especially if one of them is residing in the 2nd house. In addition, the same good luck will follow the native if his 2nd house cusp falls on Sagittarius. On the contrary, when Jupiter is adversely aspected by Mars, Uranus or Pluto, the native should be really careful with this passion. There might be some minor gains, but as Jupiter is the most expansive planet he will make this activity so frequent that will definitely create problems, even of losing properties. In case there is even one such harsh aspect to malefics, the best advice is to not indulge with gambling at all, because Jupiter can really overdo it with this matter.\nUnder the same rules fall all speculation business choices too. With Jupiter located in the 5th house, one can have great gains; on the other hand these gains can create a thirst of even more. This thirst can cloud the native’s mind, and when a transit triggers some dormant square aspect to a malefic he might lose a lot. So, always examine the natal condition of Jupiter in the 5th house before letting sheer luck decide on your wealth. \n \n\n\nThe love life of a person with Jupiter in the fifth house will be also very active. He will fall in love very times, change a lot of partners and choose depending on how much fun he has near a person. This planet does not give a lot of seriousness in his affairs; the native will adore flirting, will have a rather relaxed approach towards relationship and will indulge in a lot of casual sex. Jupiter gives an internal need to date a lot of people, but not becoming closely related. It is only after finding the correct person as a partner, that the priorities of the native change: The next step is having children, and probably a lot of them. Many times, the native concentrates fully on his children, forgetting to give the necessary love towards his partner. \n \n\n\nThis placement is one of the best a person can have, if joy is a priority in his life. He can be constantly discovering new levels of happiness, without ever getting bored of having fun. Natal Jupiter in the 5th house can make someone a real hedonist, the type that everyone wants to hang out with because he illuminates all the fun situations with his presence. The only thing you should guard from if you have this placement is concentrating on this aspect of your life so much, that you do not care about anything else than your serotonin and endorphin. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:22:55'),
(1649, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-4th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nJupiter is known to be the grand benefic, illuminating any house it is natally placed. When it is positioned in the 4th house of a natal chart, it will generally bring a happy childhood in a large and prosperous family. As the 4th house is traditionally ruled by Cancer and the Moon, the mother will play a very important role in the native’s life, providing him with a lot of love and security. \n \n\n\nJupiter in the 4th house signifies a large family; there are possibilities of having a lot of siblings or living in a large house with a lot of family members; grandparents, uncles and aunts, cousins and even distant relatives. This placement usually gives a lot of wealth to the family, and brings an abundance of food; there is constantly something being cooked and offered at the table, and the whole family eats together in a happy atmosphere.\nWith such a Jupiter placement, the mother of the native is the archetype of “the provider”. She will cook and feed all the time, even force to eat but in a funny and gentle way. She might be rather fat but also funny, and maybe is the even the head of the family. Her character is strong and fair, while she will usually have a very strong Jupiter/Sagittarius emphasis in her natal chart. Usually, she will be somehow involved in religion and has a high-level perception of philosophy, even if it can be rather abstract. There is wisdom in her, and this will also pass to the native.\nThe overall childhood is a happy period for the chart owner; there is a lot of fun and playing, while the native observes his parents being happy and prosperous. Family as a term receives a rather positive color in the native’s mind; he will probably dream to continue the same pattern and create a large one himself. Jupiter is an expansive planet, and when natally located there will be pressing the native to expand his 4th house issues during all of his life. The native might want to make a lot of children, and will definitely strive to have a large house as the one in which he spent his early years. It is a very frequent phenomenon that this house will come as a heritage to him after his ancestors pass away. In addition, he can also inherit large parts of land; all the matters concerning real estate, land ownership, agriculture and mining will turn out favorable. \n \n\n\nOf course, as Jupiter is the planet of expansion his effect can have even an adverse nature. The native who has Jupiter in the 4th house can be a spoiled child, or be the favorite one among his parents and relatives. The wealth coming from the family might make him lazy, as he could even not need to work in his life because his parents will have provided him with everything needed. Such kind of people may have a big passive income from their early years, and simply live their life with the money that their wealth generates. Is that a bad thing? Of course not! Everyone wishes to be able to live such a life. The bad thing is that the native might spend his life caring too much about feeding his lower needs, without investing in his soul. In case he understands that there are more things in life than having a good time, then he will become really happy and evolve to a conscious being. And this is exactly what Jupiter wants, empowerment of the 9th house- the house of philosophy. \n \n\n\nWhen the native will energize his 9th house, and start concentrating on his spiritual evolution rather than his wealth, Jupiter will manifest in an even better way. Not only he will generate a more prosperous life, but also grant wonderful old years. The 4th house is responsible of one’s old age, and an active Jupiter will make the native receive all the benefits; his last years will be very pleasant. Jupiter gives also a possibility of getting involved in religion- or some other type of moral system/philosophy.\nGenerally, people with such a placement are advised to not change their residence location; they will not prosper anywhere else in the world as they would prosper in their birthplace. This, of course, happens if Jupiter is well-aspected. Most of the times though, the person with this natal Jupiter is rather complacent and has no desire to relocate somewhere far. After all, the leisure that his home conditions provide cannot be easily found elsewhere, and the mother’s food is also a main reason to stay.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:24:00'),

When it is positioned in the 8th house, its positive and expansive energy affects the native’s sexual life. The 8th house is of the darkest in the native’s chart; responsible about his occult abilities, death and regeneration, inheritances and other people’s money. This placement can give tremendous powers in all these areas mentioned- and a lot more.\nPeople who have their natal Jupiter positioned in the house of death can benefit through anything connected with death, metaphorically or literally. Usually, this natal position brings big inheritances, which will pass to the native without any problems if there are no harsh aspects falling on the grand benefic. In case that there exist squares or oppositions, the native might experience delays or disputes during the process of receiving the inheritance. This mostly happens when Mercury or Saturn are involved with an adverse aspect. If the malefic involved is Mars, there can be aggressive circumstances and quarrels with other people about the heritage, while this is also a significator of spending the received wealth quickly or elsehow losing it.\nThe 8th house rules the marriage partner’s money, and such a placement definitely indicates a wealthy spouse. In addition, this placement helps in getting loans from banks or other individuals, as the 8th house rules other people’s money. In case that your Jupiter is well aspected, you should not worry about such kind of issues. On the contrary, if the aspects falling on it are difficult ones, be very careful. You will get the loan anyway, but you might not be able to return it, or you will spend it quickly and on things that you do not really need. An adversely aspected Jupiter can signify legal disputes and generally problems with the law, concerning money received from the bank, the government or another individual.\nNatives with Jupiter in the 8th house consider sex as a very important priority of their lives. They are very active sexually and reach high levels of pleasure. With certain partners their erotic life will be very spiritual, and the union of their bodies an everyday death and rebirth experience. This aspect makes sex be a lot more than just an activity: It is mysticism in its pure form. The two partners stop existing as separate beings during this act of union and transcend into oneness, being capable of entering the other realms together.\nOn the other hand, when the native does not have a stable partner, Jupiter will give him a lot of quality sex with various partners. As Jupiter is the planet of expansion, and if not obstructed he will expand beyond limits, it is wise to not overindulge into unnecessary activities. The problem with Jupiter is usually having “too much of something”, and the native should guard himself to not lose the magic of sex by spending too much energy and time on meaningless carnal pleasures. \n \n\n\nJupiter placed in the 8th house tends to give a strong interest in matters concerning life after death and the occult. The native will be highly intuitive, has psychic abilities and can excel in studying the forbidden and secret arts. The benefic planet brings protection from psychic attacks, high leveled perception of the meanings of life and death and a good glimpse of the greater picture. The native’s spiritual growth never stops and he obtains the status of the wise holder of secrets in the eyes of the other people. Such kind of people can even reach levels of losing any fear towards death and laugh at his grim face. \n \n\n\nAs the 8th house also rules the native’s own death, having the grand benefic placed inside signifies a peaceful and pleasant departure from this world. This usually happens due to natural causes, in the native’s favorite surroundings and rather late in life. His passage towards the other realms is harmonic, and he might even subconsciously understand when it will happen and get prepared for it. \n \n\n\nThis is an overall wonderful placement, in a house that can be considered of the most difficult in a natal chart. Most people are usually feeling uncomfortable with the 8th house issues, whether it is sexual taboos, the unknown, death or dealing with other people’s money. Jupiter here definitely helps in having a totally different approach to all these issues, which even by itself is life-altering. A person with such a natal Jupiter does not really need advice on these issues, except for the general suggestion to keep an eye on Jupiter in case of over-expansion.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:24:08'),

This is a particularly good natal placement, especially in women charts; they might make their dream of a wonderful marriage a reality. The same thing applies for men; nevertheless they might be more interesting in using this natal position for successful business partnerships.\nAs the 7th house is ruling the marriage in one’s natal chart, there will be definitely at least one marriage in the native’s life. Jupiter, as the planet of expansion, can even give multiple ones; this is more prominent when the planet resides in some bicorporal sign such as Gemini, Sagittarius or Pisces. The wife or husband might have strong Sagittarius characteristics or a very powerful Jupiter in his/her natal chart. The marriage partner is frequently wealthy or an authority figure, while sometimes can also be fatter/bigger than the average person. Usually, Jupiter in the 7th house gives a spouse with a good sense of humor, is kindhearted and helps the native a lot in all areas of his life.\nJupiter illuminates the whole life of the individual through bonding with their significant other. Usually, the marriage ceremony itself is phantasmagorical and a lot of money is spent on it. There will be a great number of people present, and the atmosphere will be utterly joyful. The spouse is usually religious or elsehow involved in the higher spheres of philosophy. If Jupiter is in Sagittarius or the 9th house cusp is located in this fiery sign, then the native will marry a partner from another country or a different cultural background\nJupiter in the 7th house is the best placement for becoming a negotiator. The person who has such a natal aspect has great diplomatic skills, managing to build bridges even between enemies. They also have the magical ability of turning their own enemies to friends, and turning them into rewarding relations for both. Their charm and smile can tear down most walls that other people build around them. This natal position of Jupiter is the best for co-operating with other people. It favors building business partnerships and can bring a lot of gains through contract or legal affairs in general.\nThe native’s profession can be strongly associated with some kind of mediation or lobbying, especially if Jupiter is connected with the 10th house or trining a planet placed in that house. This placement helps getting benefits from others without a lot of personal effort, just by being part of a structured business and having a passive role which generates income. \n \n\n\nAs Jupiter is ruling teachers, gurus or other influential figures, when it is located in the house of bonding there are possibilities of meeting such a mentor. The individual will be in a deep relation with him and receive a lot of inspiration for his personal evolution. Sometimes, this mentor will be the native’s spouse; in this occasion there will be tremendous admiration of him. The mentor figure will play a life-changing role in the native’s life and his benevolent and charitable character will have a permanent influence on the individual.\nJupiter in the 7th house will push the native to also get involved in charity; nevertheless the humanitarian offer to the society will not be done in person. Jupiter in the 7th house usually gives publicity in such benevolent actions, and most of the times through being a member of some type of organization, not through private initiative. \n \n\n\nAn overall great placement; the only thing that people who have it should take care of is not get into over-expenses for a wedding ceremony, or to not over-indulge in getting married a lot of times!

It is a very favorable position for one’s every day life, giving a lot of small pleasures and making the small moments interesting. Such a native will never get bored and will experience a lot of joy coming from his siblings and neighbors. \n \n\n\nAs the 3rd house rules intellect and communications, the native has a broad mind and is capable of speaking and writing well. These talents are usually not used for a profession, and people with such a placement just have them in an idle condition. They know about their abilities but are either lazy or uninterested in pressing themselves towards such a direction. Such kind of people love to talk, and will frequently pass long hours on the phone or texting friends through social media.\nThere is a tendency to love books and read plenty of them during their lifetime, as they enjoy learning till their old years. Their mind is a sponge which can easily absorb all type of information; nevertheless the third house usually brings a lot of useless data. The native should develop the correct filters to discriminate what he really needs and what not, because even if he has enormous capacity to remember things, the brain is not a garbage bin. Random and useless knowledge should be avoided, no matter if it strongly appeals him. If you have such a placement, stop opening 10 wikipedia tabs simultaneously and chaotically jumping from the one article to the other; it is better to concentrate on some important topic that will somehow aid you in your life.\nJupiter in the third house usually gives a lot of siblings, or cousins that behave like born brothers. The siblings are possible to have very strong Jupiterian aspects in their house or having their Sun in Sagittarius. The relations with them are very harmonious, reaching real unconditional love of the highest level. The third house also rules the neighbors; Jupiter brings a lot of kind-hearted people living near the native, and can develop stable and happy friendships that make neighbors act like brothers or sisters.\nThe siblings, the relatives and the neighbors can be involved in religion, law or higher education, and the time passed with them is usually full of interesting intellectual conversations where both natives gain from. People love hanging around with you and there is always a pleasant atmosphere in your social circles. You prefer to be with people that smile and laugh a lot, and this definitely mirrors back from you.\nAnother thing that the grand benefic influences while positioned in the third house is nearby travels. The native will frequently escape to short journeys, weekend trips or a country-house not far from his home, while also get involved in interesting activities and hobbies that he might have. \n \n\n\nThe childhood and school years of the native are sure to have been rather pleasant, unless Jupiter is very adversely aspected by a lot of planets. This position is generally giving a love for school and all the activities involved in it; the child adores learning, socializing and playing in the school. It is rather popular among other children, respected by teachers and taking good grades without struggling to learn. He might be even putting minimum effort, as his mind can drink the information provided in the lessons, without having to study at home. This can give them a lot of free time, which is used for playing and hanging out in the neighborhood. \n \n\n\nThere are no real disadvantages that can be created from this natal placement; the only thing that the native should be careful is overdoing with the third house issues. As Jupiter is the planet of expansion, he can literally have no limitations in how much he can expand the areas ruled by the house he resides in.

I guess most of you came to read this article out of curiosity, about how the grand benefic planet of Jupiter functions when located in the house of possessions. And yes, the answer will not disappoint you (just maybe make you jealous, in case you do not have it!)\nWhen Jupiter resides in the 2nd house of a natal chart, it indeed grants luck with money. The native is probably born to a rather wealthy family, and from his young ages getting used to a life without financial problems. This placement favors all business affairs; from law to education, from religion to travel-connected jobs; other people can easily trust the native for working with him, and there can be great support from the government, the church or generally people in places of authority. There is great possibility of inheriting a family business, or being born to a famous judge, lawyer, politician etc; this way the career of the native might have been already decided from their father, but who said this is too bad when it comes with an already guaranteed success and accumulated wealth? \n \n\n\nOf course, as Jupiter adores to expand extravagantly every life area he touches, natives with such a placement are prone to spend without caring to track down where their money go. They are used to the fact that even if they spend everything, money will somehow appear again. And in most situations this is exactly what is happening!  The person is generous and has a rather luxurious style; a famous saying states that “money is attracted to money” and this is precisely the case. The native’s whole existence smells like prosperity, and even richer people strive to hang out with them. Also, the native’s personality radiates an aristocratic positivity, which is furthermore attracting people towards them. They are born optimists, prefer to spread good words and news around them and their smile during business can be their strongest weapon of success.\nAs Jupiter is ruling the 9th house, when he is present in the 2nd he just loves spending on higher education and travel. People with such a placement will not hesitate getting into huge expenses in these areas, which in the end expand their mind even more and have as a natural outcome to bring them even more money. Indeed, the 2nd house Jupiter person is not a silly spender; they have a deep and conscious approach toward what is worthy and what is not. In addition, such kind of people will invest huge amounts into their personal beliefs. This could be self-financing the publication of their own book, of their think-tank or anything else that carries their personal philosophic views.\nA curious fact is that Jupiter in the 2nd house produces wealth even if someone is lazy. It is a financial guardian angel, not allowing the individual to fall into poverty. On the other hand, procrastinating while having such a placement is of the most stupid things one can do! He might be losing an enormous opportunity to reach all his personal goals, throw in the garbage a gift from heavens that other people would sign contracts with the devil to have.\nAn issue such kind of natives should guard of, is overindulging in sweets, food and gaining a lot of weight. Be keeping themselves restrained and taming their appetite, they can manage to handle their Jupiter and hold him from expanding wherever he wants. This piece of advice is not just symbolical, there are sugar-connected diseases present out there such as diabetes, and Jupiter can overdo it with whatever he likes to consume. \n \n\n\nThere are no real dangers that Jupiter can bring through this placement.

The 9th house rules philosophy, religion, law distant travels and benefits from foreigners, while is also responsible for all types of spiritual pursuits. Higher education, publishing and teaching also are issues of the 9th house, and when Jupiter is present there he will definitely lead the native towards a life of higher meanings and idealism. \n \n\n\nPeople who have Jupiter in their 9th house are passionate with traveling to new places; this usually broadens their mind and also triggers other matters governed by the 9th house. They adore learning and usually continue towards master or doctorate studies, while it is a frequent phenomenon that Jupiter shines back their effort towards other people, and they become professors or mentors of some kind. If Mercury is also present in the house, traveling comes together with learning new languages and generally adapting to a new culture and way of thinking. The more close their conjunction, the more possibilities exist for relocation to another country. Good luck follows the native in his journeys, and if no malefic is having an adverse aspect to Jupiter he should expect that all his travels will be troublefree. \n \n\n\nKnowledge is of high importance in their minds, and they prefer to broaden theirs in a wide sense, more than concentrating on a single detailed subject. For them, the big picture is more important even if it is more abstract. They self-educate during their whole life, which tends to become a hobby even if it is not necessary for them, as they usually reach success early in life.\nA lot of benefits can come through universities, people of spiritual power, law or the church. The native can influence the beliefs of the masses, and especially in his elder age he might engage in writing and publishing. Honesty is valued by them, and they strongly dislike hypocrisy. They have a natural curiosity, and sharing their discoveries and thoughts with other people can become a life target.\nIf the native’s Jupiter is at the end of the 9th house and conjunct the Midheaven, popularity is to be expected. The same can happen if Sagittarius occupies the 9th house and Midheaven also starts inside the sign, while conjunctions of Jupiter with the Sun, the Moon or Venus are also indicators of fame. He can easily became a leader and inspire other people; this is quite likely to happen when Jupiter trines Pluto or Mars, especially if they are located in the 1st house. In the first situation the native would be a man of politics and hierarchical power, while in the second situation his power and leadership would derive from military surroundings.\nJupiter in the 9th house is a wonderful position; yet there are also some difficult consequences deriving from it. The most frequent issue is the estrangement from friends and family due to traveling or studying abroad, and generally issues concerning friends and relatives. The native might have a big circle of acquaintances, yet he frequently does not dedicate to them the necessary time due to his long-term absence.\nIf the 9th house is occupied by Pisces, it is highly possible that the chart owner will follow the role of becoming a spiritual leader. In case there are also planets or a stellium occupying his 12th house, and aspecting Jupiter in the 9th, he might follow the road of being a monk or become a Hermit in some other way. When there are planets or a stellium in the 1st house, he would most likely be an extrovert figure in religion, far from self-imprisonment and hermetism.\nThe 9th house is responsible for publishing, writing, as long as import/export business. One should expect to get involved in publishing business either when a transiting slow moving planet as Pluto forms a trine with natal Jupiter, or when the Jupiter returns to his natal position. If Pluto is responsible for the entrance into the publishing world, then this change is permanent and publishing will be a part of the native’s reality for the rest of his life. Great success is to be expected, if there exist natal trine aspects to Jupiter from other planets, and transiting Pluto triggers them.\nThe 9th house Jupiter native tends also to find love abroad and marry foreigners. This has high possibility to happen if Jupiter is conjunct, trine or sextile Venus, or if the cusps of the 5th and 7th house are placed in Sagittarius. A person with Sagittarius at the cusp of the 7th house, Venus inside it and Jupiter in the 9th forming a sextile to Venus, is more than likely to marry a foreigner. Even if planets other than Venus are present in the 7thand form such an aspect, marriage and love tends to appear towards a person from a faraway place, or of great differences in language, customs, traditions or ethnicity.\nIn case that the 9th house Jupiter is very negatively aspected, the native might be sacrificing a lot of his personal small things at the altar of higher education. He might his entire life struggle to obtain knowledge, just to understand that he missed the opportunity to do the things he loves, to spend time with the people he loves. If the adverse aspect is a square with Pluto, the things that he sacrificed cannot return back, especially when a transiting planet triggers the square. Such kind of people usually face dilemmas of moving to another country and having to reject their past. This type of aspects could also signify relocation due to political instability or war in his country, and are by no means an easy choice as the relocation could be permanent. \n \n\n\nNevertheless, this is a rather extreme scenario.

Which are the blessings it brings though?\nFirst of all, one must understand that the 1st house is also responsible for the body and not only for character. The ascendant in particular is to be responsible for the physical appearance, and thus any planet conjunct the ascendant or close to it is having influence on our looks.\nWhen Jupiter is residing near the ascendant, it tends to give beautiful and noble characteristics. Depending on which sign it is in, it tends to give beauty to the body parts that are ruled by that sign. If, for example, the first house contains Sagittarius, the person’s hands and legs tend to be long and well-shaped, as Sagittarius rules them. \n \n\n\nThe further from the ascendant, the more influence has Jupiter on internal characteristics and one’s attitude towards life. Usually a native with such a placement is jovial and smiling, with a great sense of humor. It creates the typical shining person that brings light to other people and attracts large companies of friends. Jupiter is the planet of expansion, so one should be careful of obesity problems – especially if the planet conjuncts the Ascendant. Being the planet of luck, it brings positive outcomes in difficult situations, narrow escapes from accidents, and is considered a savior angel. Of course, one must always have in mind that depending on luck is not to be practised, as it is the few situations that luck will not work that can bring a catastrophe. \n \n\n\nThe native should be very careful with his over-confidence, which can easily arise when he observes his general luck and sees that the chances are in his favor. It takes only one bad moment that Jupiter will not work as usual; to turn things upside down. Another problem that it could create is laziness and self-indulgence, especially when in square aspect with the Mid-heaven, which frequently happens when Jupiter is located in the middle of the first house. This might not be totally bad, as Jupiter there could signify an abundance of money and resources that could imply there is no actual need of work to survive and prosper.\nAnother thing someone must be careful of, is over-generosity. Jupiter gives a kind nature, always ready to help others, but by doing that all the time someone can get easily taken advantage of by the people around him, especially if Jupiter has a hard aspect with Neptune. Being the ruler of Sagittarius, it can make the person fond of philosophy, law, and religion, creating prominent and fair priests, governmental employees, and famous personas. \n \n\n\nLast but not least, this placement gives very high possibilities of good vitality, quick rehabilitation from sickness and disease, and a long and healthy life, especially when in good aspect with other personal planets. Born with Jupiter rising? Enjoy it, but always keep your feet to the ground! This is the safest way to have Jupiter shining throughout all your life without causing you problems. Always ask it to bring you “much,” but steer shy of asking for “too much”. Be careful for what you wish for!\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 13:25:50'),
(1656, 0, 'us', 'lilith-in-12th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nBefore exploring the attributes of Lilith in the 12th house, we should mention that the article is about Black Moon Lilith. Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way. \n \n\n\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet. \n \n\n\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart. This topographical extreme point of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 12th can be one of the most dangerous natal placements she can have. AS the 12th house is directly connected with the native’s subconscious and even unconscious, she can induce a lot of fears. The house is ruling one’s sleeping routines, and Lilith can bring a lot of nightmares. The dreams will frequently have mystical atmosphere, and sometimes connected with sexuality. As Lilith is responsible of the darkest forms of sexuality, her influence may bring dreams of rape and unwanted perversions. \n \n\n\nThe 12th house is the traditional home of Neptune and Pisces, and when Lilith blends with them she can invoke their obscure sides. Especially when she is ill-aspected, Lilith can bring addictions to alcohol, drugs, and even prescription medicines. The reason is simple; her presence in the subconscious parts of the mind might make the chart owners deeper thoughts unbearable. When she is activated, she may radiate vicious thoughts and general negativity towards the individual’s mind. And we are not talking only about depression; Lilith tends to bring harsher sentiments as self-wrath, self-destruction and other negative feelings. Thus, substances can become to the native the easy way of escaping from his own mind. If you have this placement, watch out for difficult aspects with Mars, Pluto or Saturn. In case you have them, stop using any type of substances and try out alternative ways of escapism. In addition, Neptune adversely aspected to Lilith can also act as a strong malefic. In such a situation, the individual may never even understand the problematic situations that Lilith can bring, because his mind is creating a world of illusion, far from reality.\nOn the other hand, Lilith in the 12th house gives a small blessing. People with this placement despise being alone. They do not like restriction in a small place or circle of people, and this will make them be rather popular and outgoing. When they are around a lot of people, they stop concentrating on their own fears. This can even be an automated psycho-therapy, that the native indirectly does to himself. Of course, the Lilith influences still remain hidden under the carpet when we do not take care to heal them, and will reoccur once the chart owner again remains on his own. \n \n\n\nAnother positive thing that this placement can bring, is that the native does not like to suffer and become a martyr. He might be too egoistic to self-sacrifice for other people, yet this can also save him from situations that can bring pain- both physical and emotional. In addition, such a person will not enjoy anything connected with the twelfth house. So, places and institutions of seclusion will bring to the chart owner feelings of repulsion. He may hate hospitals, prisons and monasteries, while also any possibility of living in such surroundings. Also such a person will hate the idea of having secret enemies. This might be a tricky part though, as Lilith can certainly bring some. Yet, the biggest problem might be obsessive thought about possible enemies, and phobias that the mind will create itself. As the 12th house is the gate to our previous lifetime, Lilith placed there may bring karmic enemies from past incarnations. That is why the native will be born with an inherited repulsion towards enemies, and will constantly be suspicious about them. Of course, as Lilith does not enjoy 12th house matters, she will push the chart owner as far as she can from such situations.\nLilith in the 12th house is fond of secrets, many times dangerous ones. Such an individual may know critical information about others, or hide very dark secrets of his own. Again, there is high chance that those are of a sexual nature. Other types might be connected with physical abuse, traumas or other taboo matters. Another thing that Lilith can do is swipe traumas under the carpet of one’s subconscious. Such a person can literally forget a traumatic experience, especially if it happened in the childhood. Yet, it is always there, deep, ready to hurt. Even his nightmares can be connected with the suppression of such events. The subconscious itself is trying to speak out, to tell to the organism that a problem exists and is buried in the core levels of the chart owner’s psyche.\nSuch a natal placement can give very strong occult powers. It will be even more potent in case that Lilith is located in a water sign, or conjunct a planet. In case you have such aspects, be very careful about the occult roads you may follow. Learn how to tame that darkness that is hidden behind the curtains of your conscious, or else you might be tempted into creating malice through magick.\nThe best way of softening the difficult traits of Lilith is symbolically indulging in 12th house matters where the ego dissolves and is recomposed in a different character.  Face your fears, and even try psycho-analysis if the traumas are deep. In case that no traumatic events occurred in your childhood, then it will be a lot easier to even use those powers for your own benefit. AS the 12th house is the toughest one to handle, you should be very careful of how you reprogram yourself. Try a harmonic approach to those matters. Learn your mind, and choose a slow procedure of uncovering what is hidden inside. Do not be afraid if you find things, memories or events that will shock you. Embrace them and make them your power. This will be the way to create light from your darkness.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:29:18'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way. \n \n\n\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart. This topographical extreme point of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side. The placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative. \n \n\n\nHaving Lilith in the 11th can complicate an individual’s group activities, making it uneasy to express when among a lot of people. It may be connected with disharmonic memories the person has from how he was treated in groups during his childhood. He might have felt malice, hate or jealousy from other kids at school, being the scapegoat, the alien, the rejected one. This subconsciously influences the way he perceives such types of experiences during his adult life. Also, there are possibilities that he was feeling ashamed during such occasions, which can in turn create a strong drive to take a symbolic revenge.\nAs the 11th house is the realm of Uranus and Aquarius, Lilith’s presence feeds the desire of being different and unique, which can even lead to provocative extremes. This can lead to becoming a member of weird subcultures, concerning one’s clothes, music and lifestyle. This style is definitely something absurd for the average people, which will see the native as awkward. Thus, alienation from the others is something which can frequently happen. Lilith in the 11th house is responsible for not being called to parties or other collective events. In extreme cases, it can even bring being hated by collectivities and groups. Of course, this triggers a similar reaction. Hating those groups back. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, such a native will enjoy friendships that are based on one-to-one principles. There is high possibility that such a person’s friends have also their Lilith in the 11th house. Social outcasts and loners, which have experienced the same fears and traumas, tend to blend better with people of their own kin.\nLilith has a lot of seductive traits and characteristics, thus giving strong sexuality to the individual’s friendships. Such a placement can easily give “friends with benefits”, and a sexual atmosphere will be always present in the native’s friendships. Yet, if Lilith is ill-aspected, such relations can bring drama and disasters.  Lilith can cause dark feelings such as jealousy or hate, and when adversely aspected indicates betrayals. An 11th house Lilith person will be suspicious and possessive about his friends. This gives the stereotype of hating other people that hang out with his friends, due to the fear of losing them or becoming less important for them. It is even more potent when sexual desire is present in the situation. This placement can make someone be in a love/hate relation with his friends, pathologically adoring them but at the same time blaming them for anything wrong that happens in the native’s life. \n \n\n\nThe 11th house is the realm of group sexual activity, and Lilith can trigger quite promiscuous patterns of behaviors to the native. Aquarian and Uranian energy is very open for experimentations, and such natives are more open for ménage a trois and swinging. If Lilith is in Scorpio, Capricorn or adversely affected by malefics, she can lead to dangerous games in the native’s love life. In such occasions the native should be very careful of dramatic emotional events that can happen between him and friends. It is very probable that at least one of the persons involved in this complicated situation will get hurt. When Lilith is adversely aspecting Pluto, Mars or Saturn, such a chart owner might even enjoy using and hurting people emotionally.\nIn case this happens, the individual should review his childhood to see whether he was emotionally hurt by friends in his early ages. Very frequently, he will discover that potential negative behaviors to people he is related to may be a subconscious revenge towards the archetype of “friend”. The scars which remain from that disappointment in his young age may make him use all his weapons to possess his friends, including sexuality. On a higher level, the chart owner may not be even really sexually attracted to his friends, and just using sex in order to hold a tight grip on them.\nLilith’s presence in the eleventh house can make someone a cunning schemer concerning organizations. He might sabotage social groups, spread malice between their members and cause a lot of discord. The native might feel happy when seeing groups of people fall apart. This will fulfill his dark pleasures, as he feels he teaches the other people a lesson about how it is to be left without a social group. Of course, such an unhealthy behavior is more frequently present to people who have hard aspects to their Lilith.\nThe best way of softening the difficult traits of Lilith is symbolically indulging in 11th house matters where the ego dissolves in a group gestalt, and is recomposed in a different way. If you have such an aspect, try to join any type of organization, and to behave well. Concentrate on promoting harmony between the members, and try to keep your darker traits away from your behavior. Of course, there are many techniques one can use to partially get rid of the difficult traits that Lilith gives. Nevertheless, all forms of communication within a group, and collective work are very good channels for letting our darkness flow away from us.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:29:26');

This topographical extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative. \n \n\n\nHaving Lilith in the 10th can complicate how an individual appears in the eyes of the others. Lilith is quite visible to the masses around him, and will be always present in his image. Yet, as the 10th house is ruled by Capricorn and Saturn, the energy of Lilith blends quite well with their dark traits. Thus, she can be even used quite well in a conscious manner, so that the native acquires fame – even if it is negative. As we all know, negative advertisement is still marketing, and maybe even the strongest way to promote one’s persona.\nThese dark traits of Lilith may be connected with disharmonic memories the person has from his parent that was mostly dominant during childhood. The 10th house rules the dominant parent, and usually it is the chart owner’s father. Lilith placed there despises his authority, and can reach extremes in order to manifest rebellion towards him. A common pattern that can appear, especially in women charts, is hatred towards any men who have similar characteristics like her father.\nIn addition, such a person can develop wrath towards any type of authority, and can be a very difficult worker. He will create problems to his employers, disrespect them and maybe even sabotage them. If the native has a career of his own, he may treat his employees in a vicious way too. This phenomenon is quite common when Lilith squares some malefic planet located in the 6th house.\nA 10th house Lilith will create great lust of power and the need to control. The native may even use his sexuality to seduce people of higher status, in order to rise in the social pyramid. Lilith has a lot of seductive traits and characteristics, thus giving strong sexuality to the individual’s career. Yet, Lilith does not develop healthy love affairs, and in case she is activated in one’s job surroundings she will most naturally bring discord.\nIn some cases, when Lilith is adversely aspected, the native will get involved in scandals. Those scandals can even be of a sexual type, and there will be negative criticism by people of his surroundings. On the other hand, he might achieve all his goals even with the help of such negative criticism. The fuss that is created around his name can make the chart owner even more known and powerful, which later can be used to climb easily higher in the social pyramid.\nAs the 10th house is the realm of Capricorn, Black Moon Lilith can be cruel and manipulative towards the people she can control. Such a person may more easily step on corpses in order to achieve fame and success, and will not hesitate to backstab someone in his job surroundings. \n \n\n\nA 10th house Lilith may indicate a lot of jealousy towards successful people. The native will do detailed research about how someone can become famous, and create his own strategy. These strategic plans will of course be secret, and the native may be denying their existence even to close friends. In addition, such strategies may be based on quite dubious moral values, which is also another reason for them remaining clandestine. Of course, one should keep in mind that the 10th house is probably the most noticeable to others, and there is high risk of having such plans revealed. \n \n\n\nCuriously enough, such a placement is perfect for artistic performers. There is probably no better placement for dancers, as their raw sexuality radiates through Lilith in the eyes of the audience. In their movements, dark seduction can be easily noticed; Lilith adores to control sexually the minds of others. Obviously, Lilith in the 10th is a great placement for politics too. With good aspects, she can do miracles; with difficult ones though, she can even contribute to one’s fall through scandal and revelation of secrets.\nThe best way of softening the difficult traits of Lilith is consciously changing your approach towards the dark energy she carries. A necessary procedure is to forgive any people from childhood that gave rough archetypes, and find ways to channel any negative energy into constructive actions. Eventually, you will notice that your mind will become clearer, and a lot of negative emotions will gradually dissolve. Lower your pride and become less cunning; plotting and scheming is not the only way to reach success. You will eventually observe that when you start radiating positive emotions, the masses will start following you through being inspired and not provoked.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:29:35'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather dark point of an individual’s natal chart. This most furthest spot that the Moon reaches from the Earth makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative. \n \n\n\nHaving Lilith in the 9th house is not the best placement, as most astrologers claim she is in fall in the sign of Sagittarius. Indeed, the Jupiterian energies that rule this house are quite difficult to blend well with her dark powers. As the ninth house is considered the house of filosophy, Lilith can make one’s personal views fairly dogmatic, and give a lot of obscure traits. People with such a placement may use their religious beliefs or spiritual ideas in order to impose them to masses, and even control them. There can be an addiction to power connected with teaching. Such an individual may indulge in drinking other people’s energy through transforming their beliefs, or just shuttering stable beliefs that others have. This is not necessary negative, because the chart owner can be a radical person who actually helps the society progress through destroying stereotypes. Possible roles that such a person can play are that of the troll, the cynicist, the taboo-breaker and possibly uses black humor.\nThe 9th house is ruling higher education, and Lilith’s effect is to neglect the principles that education can offer. The individual does not recognize the universities, institutions and professors as authority, and will frequently abandon studying. This, of course, does not abandon learning. Such a native will prefer to learn by himself, and quickly turn towards more practical areas of life such as work. Indeed, wisdom gained through practice can be more beneficial for him than anything theoretical. In case that the native chooses to finish his studies, he will be constantly nervous and distracted, being even a bad influence for other students around him. His rebellious character cannot accept being put in patterns and borders that a higher authority imposes.\nA ninth house Lilith person will not hesitate to spread a misleading idea, and even create a wave of people that will follow it. If your natal Lilith has difficult aspects with Mars or Mercury, be very careful of what you are teaching other people. Also, if your natal Lilith squares a planet in the 12th house, your tongue will definitely create some hidden enemies; generally try to think a lot before starting preaching a certain idea which you know can create discord.\nLilith in the 9th house can create irritations connected with distant travels, and the chart owner might be approached by foreigners who have a strong Lilith in their chart. This can bring unexpected situations and power games between them, as the native will despise in them some negative traits he knows he has too.\nBlack Moon Lilith’s presence in the 9th house of an individual can have an influence on his style of writing, or in special situations lead him towards publishing radical scripts. He may be drawn towards writing dark poems and literature, involve deep sexuality in his writings or elsehow express very deep and archetypical layers of his soul. Lilith can even trigger sick imagination, which will be considered quite radical and taboo by other people. This natal aspect can aid a lot anyone who is interested in alternative literature, as his works are definitely not for the masses. Except for a writer, such a person could also become a publisher, and even achieve great success if Jupiter or Venus are present. Of course, any possible conjunction with Mercury further enhances any attempt of that.\nAnother characteristic that Lilith in the 9th house can give, is making the individual a state-of-the-arts liar. Any person with such a placement can perfectly masquerade his lies under his words, diverting the other people’s attention and generally be a master of deceit. His lies can be even having a strong theoretical background, a whole filosophy behind them. This will make them be easily believed, especially from the masses.\nBlack Moon Lilith in the 9th house can lead to sexual adventures with foreigners or people other religion. In any case, the native may be making long and distant trips for sexual reasons, have sexual partners in faraway countries and maybe even pass secretly a lot of time in a distant place. \n \n\n\nIn case you have Lilith in the ninth house, try to think before creating a cult around an idea. Your ability to influence others with your words is very strong, so choose consciously and wisely before you do it. It is always better to express your darkness through ways that will not have negative effects on others. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:29:42'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way.  Most astrologers, websites, programs and ephemeris calculate and use Black Moon Lilith.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet. \n \n\n\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart.

Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative. \n \n\n\nHaving Lilith in the 8th can complicate an individual’s sexual expression. It may be connected with disharmonic memories the person has concerning sexuality, obtained in his childhood. This does not imply sexual harassment, but the native probably has experienced the darker parts of sexuality even as an idea since he was young. He might have (accidentally) watched movies that show extreme sexual scenes. Alternatively, he may have been raised in environments where sex was described as rough and cruel. As the young person’s mind is a sponge, he absorbs those information deep in the subconscious, categorizing sex as a rather traumatic experience.\nSuch a native connects sex with death, and this is what the 8th house is all about. For him, sex is a strong simulation of death. Death can many times be violent, and those darker shades are also passed towards his sexuality. An 8th house Lilith person will enjoy extreme games and BDSM, while sometimes reach even cruelty in bed. Lilith can bring fantasies of pain, torture, humiliation or even rape. It awakens the beast, the animalistic sexual depths that do not allow the flourishing of emotions. They will never indulge in having vanilla sexual relationships; they prefer everything that is rough and animalistic. \n \n\n\nIn addition, the secrecy that the 8th house offers combined with the dark powers of Lilith will give them tendencies of unfaithfulness. On the contrary, they will not tolerate their partner being unfaithful; discreet spying and checking might be easily a technique they will use to control him. Sex can become for them an uncontrolled obsession, and their affairs will be rather cruel from both sides concerning feelings. On the other hand it will strengthen the carnal pleasure to a maximum, with both them and their partners enjoying very intense situations.\nWith Lilith in the 8th house, an individual can become a sexual manipulator. He likes to control the desires of his partners, and feed on their sexuality. In extreme cases and with Lilith having malefic aspects, the native will become a sexual vampire. The person’s sexual drive is so magical that other people find it rather difficult to defend. An 8th house Lilith person can be compared to a Siren; singing her beautiful and seductive song to the sailors – yet being a dangerous creature that can devour.\nAs the 8th house is the realm of Pluto, Lilith’s presence feeds the desire of owning other people’s possessions. We should not forget that the house is ruling other people’s money, and such a placement can also indicate a person that enjoys using resources of his partners. Again, in some extreme cases, this can be part of a plan. Ever heard of Black Widows, female spiders? Well, if there is a placement that can describe them, this is it! The 8th house rules death inheritance, and Lilith would easily drive such a person to wait for someone to die in order to obtain his wealth. An ill-aspected Lilith will impose difficulties in receiving the inheritance, and generally unpleasant and dramatic situations concerning death. There is high possibility that a death during the natives childhood has created such a traumatic pattern that will continue to reappear.\n8th house Lilith creates a mystical persona, and makes the chart owner rather secretive. On the other hand, the house of Pluto and Scorpio makes them particularly strong in uncovering secrets of others. Their powerful abilities are what makes them afraid that their own secrets will be uncovered by similar people, thus leading them to become over-protective about their own sensitive information.\nOf course, we should keep in mind that a well-aspected Lilith does not bear all that darkness. With such aspects, the person will just have enormous sexuality, and can even use it for healing. In addition, the native will have a lot of occult powers, and is advised to be careful with their implementation. Due to the fact that Lilith carries a lot of dark energy, he might feel tempted to cause malice even without a reason. In case you have such a natal placement, it is better to abstain from all types of magic until you consciously know what you use and what type of effects you want it to have on other people and you.\nA person with Lilith in this house will battle with inner fears of failing in matters connected with the 8th house. The fear of death will make him use symbolical simulations of death. This is a procedure which most of the times happens unconsciously; the soul is preparing itself for the grand passage through small doses of symbolic deaths during all its lifetime. \n \n\n\nBe extremely careful of people that have their 8th house Lilith conjuncting Pluto or Mars, or any difficult aspects of her to the malefics. In case you have such placements, consider giving love a chance in your life. It is many times the absence of love that transforms a tender person to a vicious beast.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:29:49'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart. This topographical extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the seventh house can complicate an individual’s marriage or long relationships. The native is in need of uniting with someone darker than him. Lilith makes them feel attracted to people of a mischievous character and dubious morality. 7th house people are often very kind and naïve, and therefore search for the exact opposite in order to balance their own behaviors.\nThis is created by a subconscious need to see the dark traits of Lilith in other people, so that they do not need to manifest through the native himself. Thus, it is quite natural that he is turning towards people with a strongly emphasized Lilith in their charts. For example, their significant others may have Lilith in the 1st house or conjunct the Ascendant, which is symmetrically an opposite situation than the native’s. Alternatively, their partner’s Lilith can be conjuncting important personal planets, thus granting them obscure attributes. Yet, these are not some rules that always are valid. The partner might be expressing his darkness through other ways too. Tough aspects between Pluto, Saturn and the Moon seem to be the most common in giving such dark characteristics.\nOf course, this natal placement of Lilith can be quite tricky. The native is having his life gates open for inviting individuals who may harm him. In some occasions, the chart owner might be even enjoying difficult relationships with people that might even repulse him. With hard aspects, he might receive pleasure in feeling victimized. Yet, a frequent pattern that appears is the native trying to soften the difficult character of his spouse or partner. He may feel an internal need to turn the sinner into a saint, to tame the wild beast and make it a lamb. In case that Lilith is positively aspected, the odds can be on the native’s side and help him succeed. \n \n\n\nOf course, such transformations are not the easiest thing to happen. A 7th house Lilith indicates that one’s partners may have extremely strong sexual instincts, a rebellious character and even self-destructive tendencies. In any occasion, such unions are rather problematic and usually demand from the native to invest a lot of effort in accepting the difficult parts of their partner’s psyche.\nIn addition, as the 7th house is ruling one’s business partners, the chart owner should be even more careful than when choosing his beloved ones. Failing in love or marriage can have emotional consequences; yet failing in business can be even more catastrophic. It is not wise to collaborate with people you already feel that can take advantage of you. A seventh house Lilith may bring a snake at your business doorstep; consider well before uniting your powers with it.\nWe should not forget that the 7th house is the realm of one’s open enemies, and Lilith will make them quite vicious. Moreover, if she is adversely aspected, be sure that you’re your ex-partners (no matter if in business or in love) will not hesitate to turn against you after your relations end. \n \n\n\nOf course, Lilith can also become a great teacher. The difficulties that she can bring in the native’s relations will definitely make him a stronger person. He will eventually become conscious about the problematic people he attracts, and also develop his own dark side, which is usually repressed. \n \n\n\nWhen Lilith resides in the 7th house, it can very frequently bring divorce. Bad aspects to her indicate troubles concerning the procedure of getting divorced, and usually bring matters to court. When the native’s marriage involves having children, this placement will most probably lead to intense battles concerning their custody. The same pattern appears in a business partnerships; the dissolution of the established company may need to pass through law and can be a lengthy procedure.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in our conversations!

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way. \n \n\n\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart. This topographical extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 6th can complicate an individual’s daily routines and biorhythms, while also quite a lot of job issues and relations with coworkers. It may be connected with disharmonic memories the person has from how experienced his duties and obligations during childhood, both towards himself and to others. The young native developed feelings of hate towards situations when he was pressured to keep certain daily patterns, and definitely did not like serving orders or feeling under someone else’s rule. \n \n\n\nAs the 6th house is the realm of Virgo, Black Moon Lilith pays a lot of attention to the details, ready to bite even when does not like something small. Placed here she dislikes hierarchy and submission to others, and if pressured will sabotage even her own efforts. For a native with such a placement, respect of his work is something necessary. In case he observes a dominative attitude from his employer, he will not let that pass unpunished. A 6th house Lilith suggest discord even with the co-workers, while if the individual is the owner of the business then his employees will be rather untamable.\nLilith has a lot of seductive traits and characteristics, thus giving strong sexuality to the individual’s job life. Yet, Lilith does not develop healthy love affairs, and in case she is activated in one’s job surroundings she will most naturally bring difficulties. If you have this placement, be careful; having sex with a co-worker or your employer might include a lot of passion, but take care to consider what awkward situations it can bring afterwards. Lilith placed here will bring abrupt endings, while also develop feelings of hate, jealousy and revenge. In addition, her mischievous approach may prompt the native to use sexuality in order to obtain control over other people who work in the same surroundings. \n \n\n\nA 6th house Lilith may indicate conscious laziness and procrastination, and a person who has it may develop quite a lot of strategies so as to work as less as he can. Such attitudes are affecting also other daily routines, even some connected with health. The native may simply do not care about going to a doctor or taking care of his daily hygiene. Lilith can even make him quite cynical about such matters, and he may not have a problem to renounce such patterns publicly. This placement can make someone hate doctors, be anti-vaccine ideologically and generally frown upon the healthcare system.\nIn addition, as the 6th house is ruling small animals, the native may have a pet with a rather bad character. As we always copy behaviors from our pets (and they from us), the individual may be highly influenced by some reactions and details of that animal, implementing them in his real life. With this placement, be careful to not enter in a never-ending circle where both you and your pet mutually teach bad behaviors. As you are the conscious part of this relation, behave well towards it, because its difficult traits may be reflections of your own attitude towards it.\nThe best way of softening the difficult traits of Lilith is consciously changing your approach towards daily patterns. Establish a more structured everyday reality, as any discord Lilith brings is connected with the chaotic series of daily events. Take care of your body and choose healthy sleeping rhythms. Eventually, you will notice that your mind will become clearer, and a lot of negative emotions will gradually dissolve. Lower your pride and become less touchy; not everyone is an enemy at your workplace. Search for the people that mostly inspire you (or at least do not get on your nerves) and start cooperating with them. You will observe yourself, that when you start radiating positive emotions, the other people will treat you better too.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:30:00'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather obscure point of an individual’s natal chart. This topographical extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 5th can complicate an individual’s recreational expression. It may be connected with disharmonic memories the person has from how he played in the childhood. He might have felt malice, hate or jealousy from other kids during games, dancing or sports activities, which subconsciously influences the way he perceives such types of experiences during his adult life. Also, there are possibilities that he was feeling ashamed during such occasions, which can in turn create a strong drive to take a symbolic revenge towards the world during such situations. \n \n\n\nAs the 5th house is the realm of Leo, Lilith’s presence feeds the desire of being appreciated, which naturally leads to showing off very frequently. The native needs to feel being the central actor on stage, and will frequently even develop underground strategies in order to achieve it. This can lead him even to take dancing lessons in order to dance better, build stereotypes of catchy behaviors to use them while partying, and generally find ways to attract the eyes of other people in order to cause admiration.\nLilith has a lot of seductive traits and characteristics, thus giving strong sexuality to the individual in this placement during these recreational activities. Yet, it can also cause dark feelings such as jealousy or hate from other people in the same surroundings, especially those that perceive the individual as an antagonist. And there are usually more than a few other people also desiring to be the epicenter of attention, so Lilith can create quite a lot of power games “on the dancefloor”. \n \n\n\nIn addition, as the 5th house is ruling one’s first child and the relations with children in general, Lilith can bring discomfort in such matters. This placement can make someone be in a love/hate relation with his children, pathologically adoring them but at the same time blaming them for the sacrifice of his leisure activities in order to spend time with them.\nThe 5th house is the realm of casual sex, and Lilith can bring quite promiscuous patterns of behaviors to the native. Especially if she is in Scorpio, or adversely affected by malefics, she can lead to dangerous games in the native’s love life. This will bring quite a lot of partners, constant flirting and secretive activities. Both the individual and his partners may be severely hurt through such behaviors, and the native might even enjoy using and hurting people emotionally. In case this happens, the individual should review his childhood to see whether he was emotionally hurt in love in his early ages. Very frequently, he will discover that potential negative behaviors to people he has affairs with may be a subconscious revenge towards the archetype of “erotic partner”, due to scars left from that love disappointment in his young age. If you have this placement, be careful with your urges to cheat on your significant other. It may hurt him a lot, and also your children-if you have any. \n \n\n\nGenerally, Lilith can cast an obscure shadow over the native’s sexuality, bringing dark fantasies of pain, torture or even rape. It awakens the beast, the animalistic sexual depths that do not allow the flourishing of emotions. Casual sex can become for them an uncontrolled obsession, and their affairs will be rather cruel from both sides concerning feelings. On the other hand it will strengthen the carnal pleasure to a maximum, with both them and their partners enjoying very intense situations. \n \n\n\nA person with Lilith in this house will battle with inner fears of failing in matters connected with the 5th house. The fear of rejecting his children might even make him delay the process as much as he can. In addition, there is a tendency to child abuse, or an inner battle with paranoid wishes to do that.\nLilith presence in the fifth house can make someone a cunning speculator, while also lead him to gambling games in which he will not be fair. Cheating in them will not only bring money but also fulfill the dark pleasure of tricking the other person. This unhealthy behavior is more frequently present to people who have hard aspects to their Lilith. Of course, the hard aspects usually also make him get caught and bring various other problems and misbalances afterwards.\nThe best way of softening the difficult traits of Lilith is symbolically indulging in 5th house matters where the ego dissolves and is recomposed in a different character. Join an amateur theatre organization, and act. To your alter ego that is acting, pass all your negative urges and fears. With the help of this alter ego, you will be able to somehow cleanse your real self. Of course, there are many techniques one can use to partially get rid of the difficult behaviors that Lilith gives. Nevertheless, all forms of art and creation are very good channels for letting our darkness flow away from us.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:30:07'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith, which is calculated in a different way.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where the Moon&#8217;s transits are most distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather dark point of an individual’s natal chart. The distance extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative.\nHaving Lilith in the 4th house is considered a rather unfortunate natal placement, as it directly affects one’s childhood years and family. Astrologers claim that Lilith’s detriment is the sign Cancer, and thus the traditional home of Cancer is by no means a good place for her to dwell.\nThe native’s early years are disharmonic and there are problems with at least one parent. The fourth house is responsible for the less dominant one, which in most cases is the person’s mother. Lilith can give an unloving mother that abandons her child, or does not dedicate a lot of time to it. There are a lot of possibilities that she is dedicating more time to her sexuality than raising the young native, and Lilith’s sexuality is a rather obscure matter. \n \n\n\nIn many occasions, Black Moon Lilith’s presence can bring divorce of the parents due to unfaithfulness or other reasons connected with sexuality. The child feels as an observer, incapable either to understand or to soften things between its parents. In many occasions, the native himself is an offspring of lust rather than love, and even if his parents decide to live together and try to create a family the odds are against them. Step-parents can also be involved in the child’s early years, and it largely depends on other factors and aspects to determine their nature. \n \n\n\nAs a result, Lilith may cause similar problems when the native wants to create a family for himself. Her presence in the house of home is far from creating a sanctuary, and there will be even similar characteristics in the situations between the native and his spouse as his parents had.\nThe 4th house Lilith individual tends to dedicate his time and effort in matters of the exact opposite house, the 10th. He may develop great career abilities and uses his work as a gateway to escape from being at home. In extreme cases with very difficult aspects, Lilith will create a person who uses his residence just for sleeping and prefers to pass the biggest amount of his time elsewhere.\nThe 4th is the house of one’s roots, and Lilith can bring a lot of secrecy about the native’s ancestors. There can be dark powers running in the blood of some female ancestors. In addition, the native may have experienced a lot of poisonous relations with family members. He feels a scapegoat and rejected, and the natural outcome of his life is alienation from his roots. In case that Lilith is adversely aspected by Mars, Saturn or Pluto, the young individual might have experienced a lot of physical punishment. In lighter cases or with good aspects, verbal abuse is more frequent.\nOf course, such difficult surroundings may also bring positive outcomes. Being trained in how to survive in difficult situations, the native becomes a strong character and can excel in his career- especially the type of authority positions that involve control.\nThe possible negative ancestral karma can run quite deep, and sometimes a wise decision for such a native is to not form a family in order to break the cycle that repeats the same patterns. Of course, this does not apply to people who have strong benefic planets in the houses of marriage, children and family.\nIf you have this placement, you might unravel that you possess deep instincts of emotionally harming people. As we already mentioned fourth house is traditionally ruled by Cancer and the Moon, and Lilith will frequently lure you to hurt the Moon power of other people. If you notice such types of behaviors try to deactivate them, as they are subconscious programs copied from your parents’ behaviors. You have a great chance to end these cycles – and taming Lilith can unify your light and dark side into a balanced whole. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:30:18'),

Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as something mostly negative. \n \n\n\nHaving Lilith in the 3rd house is considered a good placement, as most astrologers claim she feels exalted in the sign Gemini. Thus, in the 3rd house she is domicile, and mostly manifests as an unquenchable thirst for communication and information. Of course, as it is Lilith we are speaking about, the means of receiving that information might be highly dubious. A third house Lilith person will not hesitate to overhear a conversation, gossip, or use other obscure means of gaining knowledge about things that interest him. If your natal Lilith has difficult aspects with Mars or Mercury, be very careful of what rumors you spread. Also, if your natal Lilith squares a planet in the 12th house, your tongue will definitely create some hidden enemies; generally try to think a lot before revealing sensitive information of others.\nAs the 3rd house rules ones siblings, this natal placement can indicate a person that is using his siblings to empower his own purposes. Lilith may indicate lies towards them, and when she is ill-aspected these can even have a lot of effects on the relationships with brothers and sisters. In any case, a person with such a natal Lilith will definitely wear a mask towards the siblings, having a hidden agenda. This, nevertheless, does not indicate that there will not be love between them. The emotions can be totally real and even harmonious. A well-aspected Lilith will mostly lead to the ability of manipulating, without this being frequently implemented in reality.\nBlack Moon Lilith’s presence in the 3rd house of an individual can have an influence on his style of writing. He may be drawn towards writing dark poems and literature, involve deep sexuality in his scripts or elsehow express very deep and archetypical layers of his soul. Lilith can even trigger sick imagination, which will be considered quite radical and taboo by other people. This natal aspect can aid a lot anyone who is interested in alternative literature, as his works are definitely not for the masses.\nThe 3rd house is ruling one’s early education, and the presence of the Black Moon shows some problems in school. Those are mostly dependant on the communication with other pupil, and Lilith can bring all type of negative feelings. An early heartbreak from your first crush, wrath and jealousy towards the strongest pupil, mistreating and being mistreated, power games inside the classroom. Of course, most children are getting involved in such types of stories. Nevertheless, those who have Lilith in the 3rd house tend to experience them as utterly important for their reality.\nAnother characteristic that Lilith in the 3rd house can give, is making the individual a state-of-the-arts liar. Any person with such a placement can perfectly masquerade his lies under his words, diverting the other people’s attention and generally be a master of deceit. Her presence in the 3rd house can also have an effect on the native’s voice, making it seductive or even creepy. In any case, the people around him perceive his voice as weird and dark, and the native may have tendencies to whisper.\nBlack Moon Lilith in the 3rd house can lead to sexual adventures with neighbors or people who generally live in the neighborhood; in extreme situations can bring attraction towards a cousin. In any case, the native may be making short trips for sexual reasons, have sexual partners in nearby cities and maybe even pass secretly a lot of weekends with a hidden lover.\nIn case you have Lilith in the third house, try to think before speaking as your tongue might have a lot of poison. Your ability to pain others with your words is very strong, so choose consciously and wisely before you do it. It is always better to express your darkness through art, than directly and uncontrolled towards other people.\nDo not forget to like our&nbsp;Facebook Page&nbsp;and join our&nbsp;Astrology Community Facebook Group&nbsp;to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:30:22');

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith. \n \n\n\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet.\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather dark point of an individual’s natal chart. The distance extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as a negative spot.\nWhen Lilith is located in the second house of a natal chart, she desires material possessions. She can be very thirsty of obtaining wealth, while also objects that stick in her mind. Especially when adversely aspected by Mars, Pluto or even benefics such as Venus and Jupiter, Lilith can become overly greedy. She likes to exceed the limits, and her unquenchable traits may make the native become a wealth-vampire. The native’s approach towards money might be of a secret nature; or even hidden deep in his subconscious. For the outer world, the individual might be seeming to renounce money; yet in the inside he is quite a lot burning for it.\nYet, this by no means implies that his urge to achieve material possessions will be successful. His second house has a lot more important indicators about his financial growth. If no prosperity is shown by the planets and ruler of the house, Lilith might remain thirsty, complicating furthermore the individual’s approach towards things he owns. \n \n\n\nMoney can become a real obsession, while also can anything else the native believes should be under his control. This includes also people, ideas, virtually everything he feels he has a grip on. Lilith can obscure and obstruct his mind, not allowing him think out thoroughly and find the correct ways of obtaining the desired objects.\nIn case you have this placement, keep in mind that the tricky traits of Lilith can mislead into desiring things that are actually unnecessary, just for the sake of experiencing their obtainment. You should definitely halt and consider whether your pursuits lead towards happiness or are just a game of your mind, a vicious hunt of a delusion that actually does not grant you real pleasure. \n \n\n\nAs the 2nd house is ruling money, Lilith placed there not only creates a hassle with gaining them but also likes to spend recklessly. The native with such a placement can be quite unable to handle his money, and overspending can become an addiction. Also, another issue that he might experience concerning finances is being used and tricked by other people. Furthermore, the individual can even become overly stingy if Lilith is adversely connected with Saturn.\nLilith is connected with the fear of rejection, and her presence in the 2nd house indicates that the individual is afraid that the society does not approve his handling of possessions and wealth. This subconscious fear, though, leads him towards even more provocative actions. Indeed, the society might not even notice his patterns of obtaining and spending money, but his fear urges him to express himself in an unhealthy way. In the end, especially if Lilith is adversely aspected, he gets both noticed and criticized, which fact he later uses in order to reassure himself for the righteousness of his fears.\nIndividuals with Lilith in the 2nd house should guard against materialism, and one of the best ways to make her dark traits milder is to learn to share your resources. The native must disconnect the terms security and money, and learn to not feel inferior when he has less than others. In addition, as Lilith is also connected with sexuality, such a native should search for emotional traumas connected with possessions and belongings. The patterns of Lilith might be all outcomes of an erotic rejection in his early sexual life, somehow linked to his social class or wealth. If you have experienced such a rejection, un-root it and you will see Lilith functioning in a totally different way.\nBecause indeed, she can be a magnificent teacher and offer you all types of hedonisms – as long as you take the thorn out of her heart. And in the 2nd house, a healed Lilith will offer you exactly what the house implies. And that you secretly (or even openly) desire.\nDo not forget to like our&nbsp;Facebook Page&nbsp;and join our&nbsp;Astrology Community Facebook Group&nbsp;to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:30:44'),

Thus, we should distinguish this mathematical point of alignment from the asteroid Lilith, and also from Dark Moon Lilith.\nLilith is not a planet and is not a material object. It is the hypothetical point connected to the apogee of the Moon’s orbit, the farthest spot from Earth that the Moon can reach. The Moon is not orbiting Earth in a circle but in an ellipse, and thus this calculation shows the astrological degree in the signs where when the Moon transits is more distant from our planet. \n \n\n\nBlack Moon Lilith is a rather dark point of an individual’s natal chart. The distance extreme of the Moon makes emotion and sentiments hit a low and show their cold side, and the placement of this mathematical spot signifies quite a lot of doubtful or even negative behaviors. Under one’s Lilith can hide subconscious energies of malice and self-undoing, yet it would be wrong to consider her as a negative spot.\nWhen Lilith is located in the 1st house of a natal chart, she is strongly connected to one’s physical self, both the body and the mind. In case that she is conjuncting the Ascendant, the native will be oozing of dark sexuality, becoming an object of desire for other people. Lilith in the first house can give a very hot body, and especially in a woman’s chart can make her so attractive that other people can become obsessed with her figure. Also, Lilith placed here may indicate very bad relations with the female’s father. He can be of a violent nature, and the chart owner will frequently reproduce patterns of violent explosions in her own life.\nIn addition, the presence of Black Moon Lilith in the first house can give a tendency to wear black and morbid clothes, and generally have a rather dark and alternative style. The traits are quite common as having Pluto in the house, yet Lilith brings a less serious approach to clothing – the individual desires to look extraordinary and differ from the rest of the community. Also, taboo themes such as death and sex will be used as art and style to provoke the masses. A first house Lilith person will easily wear sculls, crosses, pentacles and everything else that will make him pass as dark in the other people’s minds. \n \n\n\nMoreover, Lilith in the first house can also give a rather provocative character. The person who has this placement can have tendencies of acting “bitchy”, indulge in mind games and manipulations and even receive pleasure from confrontations with other people. Having enemies may be a source of personal power, and they do not seem to be discouraged when not being liked by others. In fact, this helps them create an even more strong and eccentric persona, frequently making their appearance and behavior be gossiped by the society. They take pride when other people notice them and discuss them, even if it is in a negative way. \n \n\n\nAs the 1st house is associated with the native’s body and how he treats it, Lilith will spawn her magic in the native’s everyday reality through quite a lot of means. Sex and drugs can frequently appear in the native’s life, especially if Lilith makes aspects with important planets. Good aspects can even show a very responsible use of these power sources, turning the native into a very spiritual being – even if he follows darker roads towards higher consciousness.\nAn adversely aspected Lilith can make the native have quite a lot of personal demons, and suffer from existential questions and dilemmas. Lilith in bad aspect to Mars, Pluto or other malefics can bring tendencies of self-abuse, love of pain and all types of perversions involving symbolical suffering. When in a water sign or negatively aspected to Neptune, a first House Lilith can give substance addiction.\nOn the other hand, taming Lilith’s dark powers can grant the native a fruitful life full of sexuality, while also a mind that can connect to deeper realms and understand the functions of hypnotism. In any case, the native can seduce others easily even if he does not understand the mechanism behind such phenomena.\nIn case you have this natal placement, understanding how to better channel the obscure energies of Lilith will help you very much avoid any negative effects. Be careful to hold back feelings of revenge, as it can backfire at you. Also, hold yourself away from self-destruction, even if it may appear as a vice that you enjoy. Know that you are easily noticed by others, your energy cannot just pass unnoticed; thus, there is no real need of over-exaggerating in your appearance and behavior. And finally, try to keep away from trouble! In case your life indeed has quite a lot, you will understand that most of the times it was your choice to get into trouble. Yes, this produces adrenalin; but if you consciously do it then do not be grumpy about it.\nDo not forget to like our&nbsp;Facebook Page&nbsp;and join our&nbsp;Astrology Community Facebook Group&nbsp;to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:30:49'),
(1668, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-12th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Mars in the 12th house can be a rather disturbing or even dangerous placement, as its presence here indicates difficulties of expressing one’s anger and aggressive emotions. This can have as a result violent explosions when the oppressed energy reaches a critical level, and people with such an aspect must definitely learn techniques of anger-management.\nA twelfth house Mars indicates that the native can have been bullied as a child, or even be a victim of physical attack. Even if this did not actually happen, the nature of the 12th house can have brought to the individual a lot of fears concerning physical violence. As a child, he may have been frequently afraid of being beaten by other children or even his parents. This placement can create traumas or even make the native feel a coward. These fears of being bullied without being able to properly retaliate build a pattern of preferring to flee rather than fight, mostly due to insecurity of the fight’s outcome. The native is afraid of being defeated and will often avoid conflict even with a less powerful opponent, just to be sure that he will not lose.\nAlso, during the childhood years, expressing anger was being kind of forbidden. The native’s parents and other people surrounding him were not tolerating powerful outbursts of the child, which in turn was leading him to have introversive implosions rather than a healthy direction of possible negative emotions. Holding those feelings inside definitely brings feelings of restlessness, and such repressing tendencies either make him burst when anger reaches a threshold or (in more difficult situations) bring a lot of self-undoing and&nbsp; auto-destructive actions. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, Mars placed in the 12th can give a lot of power connected with the occult fields. The individual can channel his energy into studying and understanding the spiritual realms, and dedicate quite a lot of effort. Usually, as Martial energy brings actions, the individual will not only theoretically study the occult but also get involved in its practice. In case that Mars is adversely aspected, especially by malefics such as Pluto and Saturn, the person is&nbsp; advised to stay away from magickal practice because he can both create a lot of hidden enemies but also hurt other people and himself. A badly aspected Mars shows that he has no firm control of his energy and violent emotions, and thus he can even cause conscious malice to others when his wrath or hatred go beyond control.\nA person with natal Mars in the 12th house is strongly advised to strengthen its function, and the best way is by indulging into an active life. Sports, martial arts and all activities that empower the body can heal the native’s self-confidence, providing to Mars the necessary energy- and especially the necessary channels for it to flow outwards. In addition, such a native should battle his fears of anger expression and allow such outbursts. Even the fact of de-demonizing them will have a positive effect, as he will no longer struggle by burying such emotions deep in his psyche. \n \n\n\nIn some situations, the newborn individual may have experienced pain during childbirth. This can in turn make him feel that the world outside of his mother’s womb is violent and threatening. If Mars is with adversely aspected, the individual can develop fears and paranoia concerning war and mass calamities. Indeed, Mars in the twelfth there is not the best placement for such events, especially if it is located near the Ascendant. A twelfth house Mars person should try to keep away from guns, wars, demonstrations and sharp machineries, as there are quite a lot of possibilities to have an accident.\nMars in the 12th house can indeed bring hidden enemies, especially males. But what is more frequent to happen is phobias about having hidden enemies, even if they do not exist. Actually, the appearance of some real enemies among friends will make the native cautious in his approach, always searching for hidden behaviors in other people near him. Being backstabbed in the past makes him want to prevent that happen again, so he will many times even become paranoiac, imagining hidden tactics in other people’s movements. In addition, his alert makes him always ready to strike first, and there are quite a lot of possibilities that he will accidentally hurt someone just because of fear of being hurt.\nAs the 12th house is connected with social institutions, the native may have some involvement with prisons, hospitals or monasteries. If Mars has positive aspects, the native may gain quite a lot of experience from working on such projects in institutions of restriction. On the other hand, difficult aspects can indicate bad luck with those, so a native is firmly advised to keep far from any criminal activity as it may bring a legal trouble and possibilities of imprisonment. Seriously, with a 12th house Mars, the risks of getting caught are quite big, as also the chances of betrayal from a friend who is a snitch. Stay clear of anything illegal. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our&nbsp;Facebook Page&nbsp;and join our&nbsp;Astrology Community Facebook Group&nbsp;to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:31:07'),
(1669, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-9th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nMars in the 9th house is probably one of the best natal positions he can have, at least concerning the native himself. Mars will activate all the 9th house matters, which involve things that the masses do not usually reach; a lot of distant travels, a good education as long as relocation to a place that the native prefers to live. \n \n\n\nThe native will be able to channel tremendous amounts of energy towards higher education and learning. In addition, as the ninth house rules publishing, he will most probably write something that will be read from the masses. This might be connected with religion, travel, sports or even military matters. People with this natal placement can become accomplished in teaching, usually on the same subjects that are already mentioned. Mars in the 9th creates the sports trainer, the geopolitics writer, while also may make the person write about machinery and martial arts. A usual phenomenon is that he develops a circle of fan readers, whom he may easily manipulate and use for his causes.\nMars in the 9th house gives a strong interest in religion, making the native dedicate a lot of time in reading various books and writings. This placement creates the preacher and the missionary, and the person may indulge in attempts of converting others to his religion through proselytism. In cases that Mars is negatively aspected, he will be a religious fanatic or a zealot, trying to push his beliefs on other people. Of course, in such occasions he will meet resistance and his aggressive perceptions will have an adverse effect on himself. People who have their natal Mars in the 9th house are so sure about the correctness of their opinion, that become narrow-minded and offensive towards alternate views. On the other hand, they have a quite honest approach to these matters: they firmly believe in what they say and are ready to defend it by any means. Mars here gives a love of debating, and of course makes the native enjoy victories. \n \n\n\nThis natal placement will make the person travel a lot to distant places, and his activities there can also be connected with some kind of sport. In case that Mars is adversely aspected by malefics, the native might suffer some kind of incident in his distant travels. Tensions could arise with locals due to religious, cultural or racial differences, while it can also happen that he arrives to the country during political turmoil and destabilization. In such chaotic circumstances, he can be attacked or survive other types of dangerous situations; in the most extreme form he could witness some kind of war. Of course, if Mars is well-aspected only good can come from foreign places, always depending on which planets form sextiles and squares- while also the houses they are located in. \n \n\n\nThe 9th house is traditionally ruled by Jupiter, and the presence of Mars will make the (otherwise harsh) red planet have a rather humoristic approach on reality. The native will have a great sense of humor and will like good jokes. Also, people with his placement tend to laugh a lot, having a zest for life and expansion. Their enthusiasm can move mountains, and their restless heart will not hesitate to do risky steps forward. Such people can easily switch on “YOLO” mood, which if Mars is well-aspected will reward them in a way that no other mortal can experience. Yes, they are the ones that will break their borders of fear and try parachutes, bungee-jumping or other activities that require balls.\nThis natal placement of Mars may give to the native permanent relocation to some distant land, while actually that foreign place is where he will find his spiritual road. Mars in the 9th can make the native relocate due to embracing a new religion, and can even literally mean fighting for it. Mars will fill the native’s heart with fire for this sacred pilgrimage, making it a very important part of his life.\nGetting actively involved in a spiritual path is a wonderful thing. Such an individual can discover his personal truths, which will in turn brighten his existence. The only thing he should be careful of is pressing other people to receive his own truths as their. In order to ascend to higher spiritual levels, one should understand that there is an absolute and universal truth does not exist, and that every person has the right to follow his own path. Provided that the native respects this spiritual rule, he will evolve towards a higher soul and reach inner balances. Becoming a zealot though, will only quench his egoistic thirst of acceptance.

(1670, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-8th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nNatal Mars in the 8th house is one of the most potent placements for the fiery planet. Mars is the co-ruler (or old ruler) of Scorpio, before planet Pluto was discovered, and still holds a lot of power over the house’s matters. Being domicile, he will boost sexuality; nevertheless the aggressive nature of the planet can also create problems in life areas ruled by the eighth house.\nMars usually brings a violent death, which happens rather suddenly. This placement could bring a death by a sharp object, a bullet, an accident or war. In case that the planet has good aspects from other celestial bodies, it would bring at least one near-death experience.  The chart owner will get transformed; usually in a very positive way. After that experience, his gates to the other realms will be permanently more open than before, and he may even grant psychic powers.\nThe individual with Mars placed in the eighth will have an interest for the occult; nevertheless the aggressive nature of the planet will probably make him be too hasty; he will try things earlier than he is ready enough. If Mars is adversely aspected there exists a danger of supernatural attacks or experiments that will go wrong. \n \n\n\nThe native’s sexual life will be more than active. Mars positioned in the house of sex will bring fiery traits to his intimate relations and of the strongest thirst for experiences in bed. Sex is for them a very important channel of recharging and letting go all cumulated negativity. They will prefer it violent and will have an aggressive attitude over it. The native’s desire will be very strong, and all relationships will be of a passionate nature. If Mars is adversely aspected with Pluto or with Saturn, the native can become a victim of abuse, usually of a sexual nature. If Mars is well-aspected, it indicates an active breaking of taboos both of the native and his partners. \n \n\n\nMars in the house of other people’s money may bring a lot of quarrels and disagreements in this area. The native may fight over an inheritance, or have problems dividing a property or financial gains with other people. Issues can also arise in his marital life, as Mars in the 8th house indicates a marriage partner that will have financial losses. This can raise tensions inside the marriage partnership concerning joint finances. In addition, this natal aspect can be a bad indication for any type of loan through an institution. The most possible outcome is that the loan will not be paid back, which will furthermore complicate the native’s finances.\nThe native with mars in the 8th house can be of a very jealous nature, easily becoming obsessive about things. When he needs to possess something and sets such a goal, he may dedicate himself totally to it and even use dubious means to get it. This applies not only to money and material things, but also on people that the native wants to feel as being owned by him. With an adversely aspected Mars, the native can become so jealous that he may even exercise violence towards the desired person that betrayed him. \n \n\n\nIf Mars is afflicted by Mercury, these two planets combine in making the individual a successful thief. The 8th house is also ruling money of the banks or the government, and with such an aspect the native might indulge of putting his hand inside the jar. Be careful, because if you grab a lot then the hand might get stuck inside. All these Martian traits described here should be tamed, so that they do not backfire. This mostly applies to the people who see squares, oppositions and difficult conjunctions to his natal Mars, of course. The rest can relax, they probably already have learnt how to control the eruptive character of the red planet.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:32:20'),
(1671, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-7th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving natal Mars in the 7th house can be a rather difficult placement for marital affairs. As the house is traditionally ruled by Libra and Venus, the powerful red planet can bring disturbances if located here; nevertheless there are a lot of other factors to be observed before reaching such conclusions.\nMars might be considered a malefic planet, and indeed is of a rather aggressive nature. When he is ill-aspected, he will always cause tensions to whatever he touches. This could seem also the case when he is located in the house of marriage- but it is not always like that. The definite outcome is that the native’s spouse will be of a competitive and eruptive nature, no matter what kind of aspects Mars has with other planets. And indeed, the native will himself seek such a personality for a partner, as he cannot get attached to passive people. What happens after is a different story though, one that we will try to explain by dividing the situations in categories. Of course, this is only a rough template; every person is different and there is a lot more than black and white in one’s marriage. Well, in this case we are talking about red. The red of passion, which in other situations can be even the red of blood.\nMars tends to bring a marriage partner of a heavy Aries/Mars emphasis in his natal chart. He will frequently have Mars in his first house, and may be of a military background. There is possibility of him doing any type of work connected with uniform: an officer, a soldier, a policeman, a firefighter, an athlete or a surgeon. His character will be rather touchy and eruptive, while his body will be robust, well-shaped and athletic.\nMany times, the body will be a huge reason of attraction towards the partner; the sexual energy created between the two natives will be of the strongest nature- even blinding the natal chart owner.  Generally, if you are seeking for a harmonic marriage and you have this aspect, rethink it. But probably, having this aspect will make you seek the opposite, and ignore this piece advice.\nIn case that Mars is well placed by sign and well aspected, he will bring a person fond of sports and action. The couple can be engaging together in extreme activities, and find their own type of balance through expelling the Martian energy in constructive ways. They can travel together a lot, do extreme sports, both be military or policemen and so on. There will be a lot of competitiveness between them, but in the end they will both progress through it. \n \n\n\nHere, we should again mention that engaging in activities that release the natural aggression of Mars is obligatory. In case they stay too much at home and try to enforce routines, at least one of them will revolt against the other. Mars is in a strong need of releasing the adrenaline that cumulates. If this is not done systematically and in a controlled environment, it eventually reach the point of explosion. This is quite easy to understand. When you re cooking in a casserole, you do not close the lid and just leave it there. Explosion is the natural outcome.\nOn the other hand, an adversely aspected Mars in the 7th house might be more than catastrophic. Watch out, especially for squares, conjunctions and oppositions to Pluto and Saturn. These aspects can make the marriage partner violent, and can even bring physical abuse. The least they will bring is a marital life full of quarrel, with a lot of nerves and high voices. The most possible ending of such a marriage is a divorce, after a lot of trouble; especially for the native that has his Mars in this placement. \n \n\n\nIn business matters, a Mars placed in the 7th can give competitive partners with often disputes too. Roughly the same rules apply here as in the matters of the marriage; both partners will want to exercise power on each other and this will lead to power struggles. With good natal aspects, this will actually lead to a good team with an aggressive approach towards the market and can make them excel in sales.\nAdverse aspects will not only bring failures in business, but also lawsuits that will eventually harm both in some way. Generally, Mars in the 7th does not favor dealings with the law, and the native might even lose his cases due to aggressive behavior in the court. The judges will tend to be prejudiced against him, and even if he is the right one he might seem as the wrongdoer. This natal aspect can bring unpopularity after such a trial, and even public disgrace. In addition, as the 7th house rules one’s open enemies, such people will exist during the entire native’s life and frequently showing their teeth in various ways.\nGenerally, be very careful if you have your Mars placed there. The red planet does not function himself; it always takes two to tango. You are probably a similar strong source of aggression towards your partner, and what you receive is mirroring also what you radiate. Indeed, maybe you receive it in a harsher way and multiplied, but be wise enough to cut the source and direct the explosive energy elsewhere, and those would be some first steps for reaching a necessary balance. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:32:24'),
(1672, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-6th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nIn case that natal Mars of a person is located in the 6th house of his chart, his job will constantly devour the biggest part of his energy. Mars is not joking in this placement; the 6th house is not only ruling one’s work but also his health. Unless the red planet is very well-aspected, the native should be very careful to not over-work and put his health in danger. \n \n\n\nMars brings all kinds of jobs connected with physical strength and the enforcement of power. It also rules uniforms, so when placed here it can create the military, the policeman, the athlete, while also the surgeon. In addition, it gives jobs connected to operating tools and instruments that cut, different types of machinery and everything involving weapons. Thus, there is a wide range of occupations that he gives; even if the rule is that the job will be a rather active one, there are still possibilities of just being employed in a shop that sells knifes, guns or tools. Also, all categories of metallurgy fall under this rulership; this is the natal placement of the blacksmith and common occupations.\nSuch a native is never lazy and can become very frustrated when he sees others procrastinating. His patterns are rather structured, even of a militaristic type. He will wake up very early, spend a lot of hours working and most probably will impose to himself a very strict routine. In addition, he will eat and sleep at the same time every day, follow special diets for long time and preferring clothes of a certain style without changing it. These people know how to make things done, and can accomplish a lot more in a work day than nearly anyone else. Indeed, Mars in the 6th can give superpowers at work. It will also strengthen the leadership abilities of the native; what he says will be done by the ones under him. Quickly and correctly, because if they do not do it as they should, the native will explode towards them. The type of leadership the native develops is usually not the one that inspires, but the one that induces fear. Extremely pushy and very authoritarian, the native will not be liked by many; nevertheless his methods bring results.\nMars in the 6th house can indicate inflammatory disorders and high fevers; the native’s health is easily afflicted by sudden rushes, migraines and all types of diseases that make the body’s temperature rise. Curiously enough, the native’s health issues are strongly connected to anger and conflicts in his work and will follow similar patterns. If Mars is adversely afflicted then there will be frequent quarrels and competition in his job surroundings, which will furthermore create health issues, usually of a quick nature. If the native is of a very violent and argumentative nature and has chronic tendencies to clashes in his job with co-workers or people under him, the anger will definitely manifest as a disease that will need a surgery. Furthermore, difficult aspects to Mars indicate accidents in his job surroundings, mostly connected with machinery, weapons and sharp objects. One thing is sure when Mars is challenged- it brings blood. \n \n\n\nIf you have a difficult Mars and want to soften his functions consider calming yourself down and seeing your work less seriously. Fanaticism should be abandoned and the Martian energy challenged to more recreative activities such as sports. You should definitely become softer towards the people around you; it is not the planet Mars who is to be blamed- it is you, projecting his most violent traits. Thus, the only way to change the possible health difficulties is changing your own perception of your occupation.\nNatal Mars in the 6th house brings a love of aggressive animals. People with this placement will prefer to have an angry Doberman than a friendly poodle, a badass Bulldog than a lazy cat. They usually train it to become violent, which can be a huge mistake as they in the end copy its behavior and become violent too. In case that Mars is afflicted, the animal owner will get in some kind of trouble with his pet, and there is even a chance of being attacked by it some day. With this placement, we definitely advise against obtaining such a pet and training it in a way that will furthermore release the violent energy of Mars. Of course, as you sow so shall you reap; thus do not complain if such a pet as a company will make you more vicious. \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:32:28'),

Natal Mars in the 4th house feels frustrated; this is water house and his aggressive temperament can bring upheavals to the emotional emphasis that the Moon grants to all the fourth house issues.\nWhen a native has his natal Mars residing in the 4th house, the red planet is strongly connected with his roots, family and early childhood. This natal position can make the native be an offspring of a family who have military careers, be policemen or elsehow connected with uniforms and law enforcement. The native receives such archetypes that later in his life form a need of him being the leader of his personal “clan”, which can be both his family and more distant relatives. The struggle for a leadership role in the kin might bring out difficulties, as other members may also have the same type of character. On the other hand, such families can become very strong socially, and it is not infrequent that they collectively take part in organized crime or other illegal activities.\nThe native’s parents are usually very strict and authoritarian, while if Mars is adversely aspected there can be a lot of tension in the family affairs. During his childhood, he was pressured and frequently suffered quarrels between the members of his family. His parents are overprotective, while at the same moment controlling and easily angered. If the natal aspects to Mars are very adverse, the native can suffer physical abuse- especially if Pluto is somehow involved. If Mars has only good aspects, then the family will have tensions but their debates will lead to constructive decisions, even if with a lot of temperament involved.\nSuch people are also developing strong urges to protect their family. In case that a member of it is threatened, they will get outraged and release enormous amounts of fury towards the possible threat. A general advice to whoever has experienced a harsh Martian energy in his childhood is to try to smooth it by getting involved in athletic activities. It will be a pity if the same type of energy which harmed you while young, will harm your own offspring too. Understand that this cycle should be closed or at least softened or else the pattern will continue towards the generations to come. \n \n\n\nOne of the good things this natal placement grants to the native, is a very active and healthy old age. Mars placed there gives a robust body that refuses to age, and the person will be working out to keep it in good shape for long. \n \n\n\nPeople who have Mars in the fourth house can have problems concerning real estate matters, while also can suffer injuries and have all types of accidents in their home surroundings. If you have this aspect, be very careful how you handle all objects ruled by Mars in your house. Take extreme care while using sharp knifes during cooking and while operating machinery that cuts things such as electric saws. Strangely enough, this placement gives the possibility of experiencing a fire at home, or elsehow being involved with setting fire to a building. \n \n\n\nOn the positive side, the person will feel tremendous amounts of power rising inside him, mostly connected with his roots. He might be very proud of the family’s legacy, and will use this pride for reaching his goals. He has very strong survival abilities, and will be able to fight his way out in the biggest difficulties. In addition, the impulsive energy of Mars can give a quick creation of a family and makes the native rush into decisions of making children.\nIn case you have this natal placement with hard aspects, seeing a psychologist might only help you in handling the anger issues that your childhood years can bring. In case that you learn to channel the Martian energy towards positive activities, this aspect will grant you with an active life and your – so important for you- family legacy will continue and make you proud.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:32:32'),
(1674, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-3rd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving the impulsive planet Mars in the third house has a strong impact on the native’s mind and ways of communication. Such people have very active minds that can even become aggressive. They like to argue and debate and receive pleasure in verbally defeating other people.\nWhen someone has Mars in the third house, his speech can be offensive, and will frequently hurt people with what they say. Even their humor can be sarcastic and provocative, while they also tend to speak without beforehand thinking the consequences of what they say. Even when realizing they are wrong, they do not confess it and prefer to defend their first opinion with every way possible. It does not take a lot of effort to make them nervous; Mars in the house of communications has a special button that can easily trigger a furious response.\nMars in the 3rd house gives a lot of fighting with siblings, which is mostly frequent in their childhood. The quarreling nature of the red planet has such an effect on neighbors too; it will frequently bring tension in the native’s nearby surroundings and raise the tone of the voices. The curious fact is that many times the native is the bad neighbor, and not the other person! When Mars is adversely afflicted, then the chart owner will be deliberately seeking trouble, just for the sake of arguing. This is a rather unhealthy behavior, which creates an overall bad atmosphere for his everyday life and should be definitely kept under control. When Mars is left untamed in his bad traits, he can become really malicious, mirroring back to you the evil that you unleash. \n \n\n\nTheir childhood years were probably rather difficult, and their school and neighborhood were not peaceful. As children, they have usually suffered bullying and also been victims of it. The area of their childhood residence is usually a violent and unsafe one, with raging criminality. The constant subconscious fear of their neighborhood creates their alertness towards external threats, as a way to survive and feel safer in this dangerous environment.\nThe native with such a placement will frequently go to short journeys; their nature though will be rather impulsive and forced. They can have a violent hobby such as hunting or some martial art, connected with these nearby excursions. Mars in the 3rd house creates a hyper-energetic person, who feels rather restless and does not know how to release the abundance of mental energy. Their hasty way of thought can lead to a lot of quick wrong decisions, so such natives are advised to invest in developing a more analytical thought. Learning how to wait before taking a decision or speaking will calm down the explosive energies of Mars and help the individual structure his reality in a better way; such an approach might even teach him how precious a peaceful atmosphere can be in their daily reality. This is the way of healing the traumas that keep the mind alert, reducing the subconscious stress that is dominating their everyday life.\nOf course, such type of a mind can be useful for a lot of professions. Every job that needs an aggressive speech will be successful. The only issue is that most of these jobs have a very flexible morality; the native would excel as a political agitator, in propaganda and spreading rumors, as a low-ranked military responsible for educating neophytes by oppressing them and breaking down their defenses and character into pieces. Every job that is based on verbal violence and arguments can go well, but we firmly advise all natives with this placement to not indulge in unleashing uncontrolled Martian powers onto others. When Mars is allowed to function at will, he can create a fanatic, a sadist and someone who enjoys getting into situations of ecstatic frenzy.\nThe third house is ruling everything that is crafted by hands, and the presence of Mars can create a great blacksmith, weapon creator, knife handler or surgeon. Especially when Mars is only positively aspected by other planets, the person is advised to enter into such kind of Martian professions that involve metal and sharp objects, as his mastery can reach unique levels and he can offer a great service to the humanity.\nA last advice for all our friends who have Mars in their 3rd house! Do not drive fast. Especially if you are driving a motorcycle. We all know that the third house is ruling transportation, so when Mars is present in the house and adversely aspected there are extreme dangers of accidents. Be even more careful if Mars is afflicted by Uranus, or Uranus is also present in the house. The safety of your body should be of your first priorities and you really do not need to be cocky and show off yourself with your new motorcycle. Be patient; increasing your speed while driving will probably shorten your trip by ten minutes, but why to risk arriving in pieces or not arriving at all? \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written! \n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:32:37'),
(1675, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-2nd-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen Mars, the red planet, is located in the second house of a natal chart, its impact mostly affects the life areas that are connected to money and possessions. Mars might be considered a malefic, and indeed functions like that if poor by placement in a sign or adversely aspected; yet if it is strong by position and well-aspected can bring a lot of wealth to the native- through hard work and a lot of effort of course. Such people are usually overly materialistic, measuring their own success and self-confidence by their belongings. \n \n\n\nMars is one of the most impulsive planets, and gets irritated when pressured. The individuals that have their Mars placed in the second house prefer to have their own business and actively create their money, as they do not like to work for someone else who will keep the biggest part of the gains for himself. They are hard workers; their profession is a battlefield where they want to be by any means victorious. Financial gain is for them the loots gained through this battle, and spending them is their celebration dance after the victory. As in any war, the spoils gained are not to be shared with others even if they fought together; problems can appear between them and co-workers in sharing the gains. The native’s money is spent rather quickly; Mars in the second house creates a person that usually buys things hastily.\nFor a man with such a placement, possessions are closely connected with his masculinity. The more he has, the more man he feels. In a woman horoscope this aspect is mostly connected with feelings of security rather than proof of being strong and raising self-confidence. A woman with such an aspect might be a lot more interested in possessing other people, especially people that are big spenders, athletic or have some type of power over the masses. They are attracted towards military men, and if Mars in the second forms an aspect with a vital planet in the seventh house a marriage with a military person is probable. The same applies if Aries is on the cusp of the 7th house, or Mars aspects the ruling planet of the 7th house. \n \n\n\nThe material goods acquired by the person who has such a placement are a fetish that they do not like to share with other people. They do not like lending their personal stuff, are possessive and adore admiring their belongings. Sometimes, they do not use their belongings themselves in order not to damage them or make them wear up. For them, what they own is a symbolical collection of moments, each material thing has also the value of the time and effort spent so that they manage to acquire it. Their impatience makes them want to gain quickly the objects they desire, so their morality can become rather flexible if the right opportunity occurs. \n \n\n\nAnother category of objects that a second house Mars adores, are weapons. These can become also objects of fetish, either through just being decorations for his walls or by using them as a hobby.  A person with such a placement might invest his money in real weapons, replicas, or even collections of war memorabilia. The native should be always careful with the local laws; having a real weapon in his house without the necessary paperwork might not end up well.\nIf Mars is heavily aspected by Neptune, Mercury or Pluto, there are possibilities of using non-honest ways of acquiring things. This could be by stealing, swindling or even violence, depending on the aspects and the conditions of the other planets involved in this placement. The individual might spend a lot of money on sports, either by watching them or gambling on them. The second will definitely appear if his Mars aspects some planet located in his 5th house or is otherwise somehow connected with the house.\nIf Mars is adversely aspected by other planets, it can also indicate loss of wealth during difficult transits. This can happen through unexpected expenses, robbery, or debt payback if there exists an opposition with some planet located in the 8th house. The individuals that have such an opposition, should keep away from receiving loans, because payback will be utterly difficult and will bring a lot of problems.\nThe best way to soften this placement of Mars is to engage in athletic activities. Also, trying to share your possessions and offer to other people will blunt any difficult aspects that your natal chart might have. When you allow the cumulated Martian energy to explode in controlled ways, there is less risk to harm others, and your Mars will function better, bringing you more gains. Keeping an egoistic attitude will just feed this explosive time-bomb you carry; the result will be a major uncontrolled explosion in some random moment. Try to disconnect your feelings of security from your material possessions, simulate for yourself a different environment to learn acting in different situations than the ones you try to force upon your reality, and it is guaranteed that you will live a lot more happily and appreciate what you gain. Even if you do not change your attitude towards your possessions, as this reaction is probably created in your early childhood where material things and their ownership were quite misbalanced in your perception.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:32:41');

(1676, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-1st-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nMars is the traditional ruling planet of the first house, because the house is associated with the first sign of the zodiac, Aries. Representing life-force, activity and the struggle to survive and conquer, Mars is creating a highly energetic and dynamic personality when located in the house of self. This is a great position for the red planet to reside in, even if the abundance of energy can lead to aggressive behaviors and other trouble caused by rash. \n \n\n\nThe native yearns for independence and is quite straightforward. Life is always a battle, and for planet Mars there is no other outcome than victory. Individuals with such an aspect are spontaneous, which can lead to difficulties due to inconsideration of all the parameters of situations that appear. It is a common phenomenon for such natives to get into fights due to their explosive temperament; yet, they usually are the ones to win because Mars tends to give an athletic and strong body. It is also very common that the native is into martial arts or other sports activities that furthermore empower his carnal self. The best advice for handling well this powerful planet is to tame these eruptive energies and channel them into healthy activities to get the best out of Mars’s force. \n \n\n\nThe first house rules the head and the face, so there is a possibility of having cuts or burns on it that might leave a scar. It is many times easy to distinguish a person that has Mars in the first, from marks on his face. Such types of people are also prominent to high fevers when they are sick, especially if Mars has some adverse aspects to other planets with an effect on the body such as the Sun. Also, a first house Mars person must guard against accidents, especially those that can happen because of his impulsiveness and enormous self-confidence. Daring without taking precautions and considering the risks might usually end up in lucky results, but it is the one time when luck will not work that is enough for a catastrophic situation to happen. Be careful when using machinery, weapons, knives, tools, and everything that is somehow connected to Mars and Aries.\nBoredom is maybe the worse feeling that a first house Mars person can experience; if the surroundings are not interesting enough to fill them with enthusiasm, such a native will end up a boiling casserole- and the best thing of course is to change surroundings. Feelings of frustration will frequently appear when they do not have something to do; Mars needs to keep himself occupied with something and laziness is not an option. Even when they are procrastinating with their obligations, they don’t just spend some lazy time but rather invest their time to other activities they indeed find interesting. For sure, they can accomplish in one day a lot more than the rest of the people. Nevertheless, they must consciously choose to not become overly dominating towards other people, if they wish to be in harmony with the rest of the world. This is because most other individuals have a slower pace, and it should definitely be respected; the world cannot just adapt to their hasty approach of reality.\nEven if Mars in the first house might make the native prone to surgeries, their recuperative powers are very strong and they heal very quickly. They have a higher chance of fracture their bones and other injuries than any other placement could give; a reason for this happening is also that they are physically more active than anyone. A couch potato has definitely less possibilities to suffer an accident, than a person who is involved in extreme sports. Usually, their athletic abilities and strong body last long years, granting them an active old age. \n \n\n\nMars in the first house gives a pioneer; there is a strong urge to discover life and people who have this natal position ignore the wisdom and advice of elder people.  If Mars is aspected with square, opposition or sometimes conjunction by Pluto, Saturn and Uranus, the native will develop self-destructive behaviors, many times because they even feel that even their own self is a jail for their freedom. Women with Mars positioned there can have quite a lot of male characteristics and succeed in traditionally masculine jobs. If their Mars is afflicting Venus or/and Uranus, their masculine traits might also affect their sexuality, either by preferring women or by being the dominant person in their relationships with men. Similar sexual preferences can occur with men having Mars afflicted in the first house, but no matter which gender they prefer, they like to keep the power of dominance for themselves. \n \n\n\nOverall, Mars situated in the house of the self is quite a positive natal placement. In case that the planet is only positively aspected, there is absolutely nothing to worry; other natives would envy you for this gift as you will be able to accomplish a lot more things both in your everyday reality and in your life as a whole. The only enemy you have is your own self, and your heightened self-confidence that might lead you acting without thinking. Taming your Mars is not the easiest thing, as the planet actually does not allow to be tamed. Nevertheless, chanelling its energy can easily make it co-operate with you, and physical activity (with all precautions of safety) is the best option. A last hint that might change the functionality of the planet in your chart: Do not try to be the Alpha male, even if this would naturally happen in case of personality combats. You might end up easily to be an Alpha male, but there might not be any other males left in the pack. And then, starts boredom, which is a worse enemy for a first house Mars than sharing power with others.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:03'),
(1677, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-11th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nWhen Mars is in the 11th house, the house of friendships, groups and organizations, the native dedicates a lot of energy and effort towards empowering and maintaining his position in society. His public image is of great importance, and he strives to become a center of attention.\nMars in the 11th house can be a double-sided knife; when well aspected it can grant great leadership abilities. On the contrary, when hard aspects apply on the planet, his friendships and unions with groups can be quite competitive and destructive, becoming a thorn in the native’s soul instead of being a road of self-development. \n \n\n\nThe native usually strives to form groups so that he achieves his personal goals, and enlarges his cycle frequently without caring to nurture previous friendships. His approach towards obtaining new friends is rather aggressive and competitive, often battling with them on Alpha Male roles. He might join sports organizations or military-centered clubs, seek friends through hobbies that involve physical activity or that have something to do with weapons. When natal Mars has a difficult aspect (square, opposition and sometimes conjunction) with Jupiter, the amount of friends and acquaintances tends to get out of control, creating problems of sentimental instability to the native. Everyone seems to be a friend, but the real ones are either none or just a few. Even in the latter, he most probably does not recognize them, as he mostly dedicates time to the most physically active friends than to the ones who have him more dearly in their hearts.\nEven if the native enjoys groups, he cannot be called a team-player, and diminishing his egoism would be one of the best ways of self-development and spiritual progress. When the native understands that cooperation is necessary for the fulfillment of his own ambitions, the positive traits of Mars will be triggered and the planet will start to function more harmonically. Also, fanaticism should be by all means avoided; Mars in the 11th can frequently drive the native to become part of groups that are hatred-based and which will furthermore debilitate the functions of Mars in his natal chart. \n \n\n\nBecoming a part of such groups might be an outcome of a difficult childhood, where the native was frequently bullied by other children and tries to regain confidence and meaning in friendships. Unfortunately, sometimes he tends to react the same way that he was treated, spreading the same pattern to other people. Bullying and physical molest in childhood are mostly present in people that have Pluto, Uranus or Saturn square natal Mars. In case that Mars is positioned in Scorpio, there could be also sexual abuse of some type.\nGenerally, people with Mars in the 11th house are very passionate, searching for active people as friends and trying to dedicate a lot of time in activities that involve some type of movement. They get bored quite easily, and if the friend does not have the spark of action inside him, they quite easily abandon him. They are definitely not submissive types, which actually makes a lot of friendships pass awkward phases of competitiveness, as they are not attracted to passive types of people. There exist frequent power games with friends, and being the center of the group really matters to them. They can only allow people that they genuinely admire to be center of their groups, instead of them. If they do not like the person that is the center of the group, they either leave or try to gain his position, sometimes using mischievous means to obtain it.\nTheir friends are usually having strong Aries/Mars characteristics in their natal chart, and quarreling with them is rather frequent – even if it is lighthearted and for fun. They tend to be impatient, and receive great satisfaction in being admired and lead. When they are lost in the crowd, though, they get frustrated and can easily erupt. They do not like governmental rules, nor being patient in situations as standing in lines. If Mars is aspecting Uranus, they tend to join anarchistic or other revolutionary groups, and generally get involved in riots and other types of actions that bring disorder.\nIn case that Mars is only positively aspected by other planets, the native will rise in power in his group and become a head of it. The nature of the group is usually determined by the sign where the 11th house cusp is located, and if it is Aquarius it usually involves some kind of political agitation towards revolt. If in Scorpio, then there is high probability of being part of a secret society, often having either money, magic or sex involved. If the cusp falls in Aries, then the organization is either of military or of athletic purposes, while when the cusp lies in Leo or Pisces, theatre and artistic performances could be the concept. \n \n\n\nAnother thing that the native with such a placement should be careful of, is possible oppositions of Mars in the 11th to planets in the 5th house. If such an opposition exists, then there is high possibility of difficulties between love and friendships. They either tend to fall in love with friends, or to lose their loves because of friends. It is quite likely that some friend of them gets in an affair with his significant other, which of course afterwards makes Mars in the 11th explode its aggression with all the consequences that this could have. A third issue that could appear is to have to choose between love and friends, as there might exist situations where these two sections of life cannot function together at the same time.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:12'),
(1678, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-5th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nThose born with natal Mars in the 5th House are blessed to live a life full of activity. As the fifth house rules everything that is recreational, fun and promotes self-expression, Mars makes the native dedicate his energy towards affairs ruled by this placement. With the 5th house traditionally ruled by Leo, Mars finds a positive fiery surrounding to express and feels quite at home. This placement is rather positive, and if supported by beneficial aspects can lead to a very vivid and joyful life. \n \n\n\nThe 5th house involves everything linked to playing, should it be flirting, being involved in physical recreational activities, gaming or even gambling. The red planet placed there influences all types of pleasure and indulgence, offering to the native a playful reality. Fun is something very important in their lives, and they strive to engage in activities with friends, being usually the ones in the center of them. The strong competitive spirit usually makes such natives bad loser, but even then the procedure of the game is what matters for them the most. Such kind of people are great for becoming sports coaches and working with children athletics, and can easily become a role model for them. Leading an active lifestyle is something very important for them, and outdoor activities in the nature are pretty common. These people cannot just close themselves in 4 walls; Mars needs freedom and does not accepts being captured in a stable reality. \n \n\n\nAs the fifth house is also connected with love, Mars placed there would make the native approach his sympathy without shame. Indeed, they tend to make the first step, and numerous love affairs is a common pattern to be observed. Mars loves to conquer, and he does not easily accept losing in this particular game. Multiple partners, sudden attachments and breakdowns are frequent to appear, and this could lead to the natural outcome of breaking lover’s hearts and emotions. Mars needs to socialize, to conquer more and more, and does not feel well when everything is programmed and stable. Such kind of people are enjoying the struggle of obtaining something new; they see that as a game and sometimes cannot even realize that this could lead dear people around them to disappointment.\nMars here is beneficial for having children, and the most probable is that the first child will be a boy. If not, then it will either have a lot of Aries/Martian characteristics, or will be hyperactive and behave like a male. In any situation, the child will copy the parent’s approach towards life, fun and physical activities, and become a very active person itself. The native should be very careful to be soft and tender in his approach towards the child. Mars is usually bringing strict discipline, and the parent should always keep in mind to not exercise physical or psychological violence on the child. Both the child and the parent should exercise sports or hobbies, to channel the possible aggressive behaviors into constructive activities.\nThis placement makes the person highly creative, investing a lot of his energy in his hobbies. Hobbies tend to become their personal way of meditation and of expelling superfluous energy. Taking risks makes their adrenaline and serotonins flow strong, even if this can also lead to the natural consequences of losing. Gambling is a beloved activity for a 5th house Martian, but in case there are negative aspects with malefics big losses are indicated. Having a difficult aspect with Neptune can make the native combine gambling with alcohol or other substances; of course the most possible outcomes in such situations are disappointments both for them and the people around them. Nevertheless, if there exists a trine with Jupiter or Venus, the native has high possibilities of earning through such games. The same applies when Uranus is in positive aspect, but in such an occasion the gain would come unexpectedly and not through regular gambling. \n \n\n\nPeople with Mars in the 5th house can excel in theatre; most times this will not be something professional but rather exercised as a hobby. They can join amateur artistic clubs, but usually their need for competition brings tensions and they can frequently change groups. They tend to also use melodrama in their personal life, which can sometimes be funny but also turn hurtful for their dear people. They like to show off their abilities and adore getting attention; of course this could even ridicule them if their abilities have not reach a respectable level. \n \n\n\nA person with this placement should be careful not to explode his suppressed anger onto dear people, especially in situations when he feels losing in some competitive action, or that control is out of his hands. Softening can occur when the positive qualities of Mars are used for channeling the aggression. The person must realize that egoism is his primal enemy, and that by controlling it he can actually enhance the quality of his recreational time. The people around him would feel fair-treated, and enjoy in such activities; else it is probable that the native will be not followed by them into games and fun.\nIf natal Mars is very close to the 5th house cusp, and in very difficult aspects to Uranus or Pluto, the native can have suffered child abuse. In such a situation he should be very cautious that this pattern does not occur towards his own child, because it is hidden deeply in his subconscious and can appear as an uncontrolled motive. The native will be striving to give love to his child, but not understanding that his eruptions can create an unhealthy environment to it. When the aspects involve Neptune, the native can even not remember his acts or words of violence. This can happen both by being under influence of alcohol and other substances, or by neurotic subconscious outbursts that afterwards are buried into the depths of the mind rapidly.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:17'),
(1679, 0, 'us', 'mars-in-10th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nMars is the planet of force, the masculine drive of moving forward and battling your way through surroundings. Therefore, located in the 10th house which is responsible for one’s establishment and reputation, it affects everything associated with the individual’s social image. Professional roles and their fulfilments, career orientation and honor are just some of the subjects that are ruled by the 10th house in a person’s life. Also, it represents authority figures and thus, anything that has to do with governmental services is depicted in it. The dominant parent can be observed through the 10th house condition, as he has been leading the native as a role model in the first steps of his life. In general both people and organizations that have power over a person, and the way that he exercises it on others are shown in this celestial area of the chart.\nHaving Mars in this house gives a life orientated about personal success and achievements in one’s career. Nevertheless, it by no means grants success by itself. Mars as a personal planet shows the direction towards which effort is being made; it is the aspects with other planets that shows whether success is to be reached or the efforts will be mostly in vain. The condition of generational planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) and their aspects to Mars have a big role, for they are the ones opening the gates to successful recognition from the masses. \n \n\n\nMars in the 10th house drives the native to fight and struggle for respect through all of his life. This, along with the martial characteristic of the planet, can guide someone to choose a military career. Indeed, this placement can make a native strive to recognition through raising his rank, which can also appear to many people that have Aries on the cusp of their 10th house and important celestial bodies inside. If Mars is not aspected well, it can bring disputes with other military staff and unhealthy competition. One should be very careful not to indulge in behind-the-scenes activities in his working place, as there is high possibility of being discovered and disgraced. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, the raw energy that the planet enforces on 10th house matters gives a lot of enthusiasm to the native, strengthening his will to fulfil his goals. In a woman’s horoscope it can bring a manly approach to career matters, making her more powerful than men in her surroundings in promoting ideas and enforcing decisions. The person has the need to do the things his own way, granting strong feelings of success when his ideas are implemented. On the other hand, failure is for him a sharp knife that when occurs is hurting him more than it would any other average person. Failures can have aggression as an effect, a pattern which is highly likely to have passed from the dominant parent, especially if Mars is poorly afflicted. It makes the individual prone to resign from his profession if his honor is at stake, or if he takes some failure very personally. \n \n\n\nAs Mars is ruling physical power, athletics as a profession strongly connected with it. Mars also is the ruler of all jobs with uniforms, thus being responsible for careers in the police and for doctors, especially those who are of chirurgical background. We should not forget that knifes, sharp instruments, and generally everything involving metal, its use and its transformation are under the influence of the red planet. A lot of important surgeons have Mars in this house. The presence of Scorpio on the house’s cusp, or adverse aspects from Pluto to Mars can create a person who actually takes pleasure from using knifes, even from inflicting pain to others. This does not mean though that he would not be a good professional. The adverse aspects show conflicts and emotional separation from the dominant parent in the young ages, and can manifest accordingly in his vocation. Mars being in Taurus or Libra is an indicator of moral scandal, and natives with this placement should concentrate in keeping their ethics and strategies clean in their profession.\nAll these apply even stronger when Mars is near the Midheaven; then power can become an obsession. Sometimes it is wiser for the native to work alone and not in a group, in order to avoid conflicts and aggression. Another pattern that is frequently observed, is that the placement can bring success in quite young years, which is indeed common in careers like the military or sports. A negative impact that Mars frequently has when in the 10th is few good human relations with people, mostly because the native himself tries to dominate his surroundings and is prone to be competitive.\nThe most problematic aspects that can occur are squares, oppositions and conjunctions with Saturn, Uranus or Pluto. People with such kind of placements can have problems with the government, troubles through their aggression and violent behavior, and should exercise techniques of reducing their anger and channel it elsewhere. By strengthening the difficult natal positions with handling their violent outbreaks, they can harmonize all 10th house issues and also heal the remnants of conflicts with their parent. \n \n\n\nIn sports, this position can signify the athlete that is not a team player, influencing adversely his acceptance from others even if he is in physical terms better than them. The lesson needed is to understand that unless he harmonizes his activity with the rest of the team, the difficult aspects that might exist will be triggered, leading to a lack of balance in other fields of his life too. The native has a strong urge to show off his body and physical abilities, and should be careful not to overdo that. On the other hand, Mars there indeed gives good body characteristics and performances, especially when the Ascendant falls in Aries.\nUnder no circumstances should such a native exercise physical abuse towards his family members. He might have experienced it himself and have it as a normal recorded way of acting in his mind’s patterns, but this is his chance of stopping the loop. In case he succeeds to push his aggressiveness towards constructive actions, the rewards from life will be generous. And for him, they would matter even more, because they would be highly connected with 10th house issues, exactly the ones that he is all his life striving for.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:21'),

Jupiter here may bring some type of involvement with institutions such as monasteries, hospitals and prisons. This placement makes the native a very compassionate person, willing to offer his services in order to comfort others. The presence of Jupiter here gifts a great intuition and a thirst to expand in the fields of psychology and healing.\nAs the twelfth house is responsible for both the collective subconscious and the individual’s deeper layers, Jupiter here will expand knowledge and will need less effort to understand the hidden functions of the human mind. A person with such a placement can even get deep into metaphysical studies, while the benefic planet grants protection from malicious supernatural attacks and accidents during roaming the inner fields of minds or the outer areas of reality. \n \n\n\nOn the other hand, Jupiter in the house of secrets might bring up some issues, as the planet’s expansive nature may create difficulties in keeping secrets, both the native’s own and of other people. In case that Jupiter is adversely aspected with Mercury, the individual should really be careful to think before revealing sensitive information, as he can hurt others or create misunderstandings. \n \n\n\nGenerally, Jupiter placed in this rather difficult house can be of great aid against all types of unexpected difficulties. Jupiter will protect from hidden enemies, and actually even make them change their approach towards the individual. The planet will not only shield the native but also can make the enemies realize the wrongness of their actions, and bring honest apologies towards the chart owner. Such events can afterwards create great friends, even if this procedure of making your foe a friend can feel rather awkward.\nNatal Jupiter in the 12th house can many times signify that the chart owner hides his religious or philosophical beliefs. He might have been brought up in a family that does not really accept the child’s road to spirituality, and so the young native develops his beliefs away from other people’s eyes. Alternatively, the native can be living in a cultural surrounding that does not tolerate differences in beliefs, and can even be pretending to follow a different religion just so that the people who surround him do not mistreat him.\nThis natal position of Jupiter by house can bring quite a lot of paranormal events, mostly of an uncontrolled nature. Of course, the benefic energy that planet Jupiter bears will mostly bring positive outcomes from such bizarre situations. The combination of Neptunian and Jupiterian energies can even create miracles, materialization of prayer and other profound and life-changing spiritual experiences.\nMany of these experiences will manifest while the person chooses to live periods of solitude and meditate, and he should be careful of whom to reveal them to. There are quite a lot of possibilities that he will not be believed by others. In addition, the Neptunian traits of the house will make such events strictly subjective, passing certain meanings that can only apply to the life of the native. This will make such events barely understandable to other individuals.\nSuch a placement will make the person be an altruist and a dreamer, frequently indulging in visions of utopian societies where personal benefit does not matter. No matter how wonderful such ideas sound, the native with such a placement is advised to always keep one foot on the ground. His philosophical approach of universal love may be theoretically correct, but it is always better to keep a trace of common reality. In fact, a stable basis on reality can be of great aid to expand towards alternative realities; the best way to jump to the skies is to have stable ground under you. \n \n\n\nWhen Jupiter is residing in the 12th house, the individual should be careful to not allow the planet expand any possible “martyr syndromes” that can dwell deep in his mind. His self-sacrifice tendencies for others can often help other people, but it would be quite wrong to constantly create similar situations, just to feel being of use. In the end, this can lead to being taken advantage of, or elsehow self-destruct – even if Jupiter is well-aspected.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:30'),

These may involve a lot of eating and drinking, while also deep philosophical conversations as Jupiter is the traditional ruler of the 9th house and higher meanings. Jupiter will bring quite a lot of happiness in being surrounded by people even if adversely aspected. Difficult squares or oppositions mostly signify problems of having too many acquaintances and friends, and indulging too much in group activities, which can make the individual tired or dedicate less times to other matters of his life. \n \n\n\nThis natal placement of Jupiter can bring great success through working in groups, as it promotes harmony and good collaboration. The native can even become a good leader in such organizations, especially if Jupiter is well-aspected by the Sun or Pluto. An 11th house Jupiter promotes all humanitarian causes, as the planet’s energy blends with the Aquarian nature of the house. This can bring great success in all organizations concerning aid to the humankind. In addition, other possible central interest of such groups may be education, social structure or even religion and the law. \n \n\n\nAs Jupiter is also ruling foreign lands, its natal placement in the eleventh house may indicate a lot of friends from abroad. Usually, conversations with them involve a mutual sharing of cultural traditions, thoughts on different religions while also exchange of ideas concerning traveling.\nThe 11th house is also considered a house that rules money, but not in a constant or direct way such as the 2nd and the 8th do.

Jupiter placed here is the best natal aspect someone can have for such a celestial gift, and there will be probably some friend’s help involved in achieving it. In case you have an eleventh house Jupiter, examine whether you have the cusps of the 2nd or 8th house placed in Sagittarius; if yes then you have even more possibilities of observing such a pattern happen in your life.\nJupiter gives quite faithful friends; a person with such a placement is lucky enough to have a lot of support during all life periods. He will literally never be alone during his trouble and there can be numerous people fighting side by side his personal battles. This is a direct influence on his own attitude towards his friends; the individual invests a lot of time and care towards the people he considers important.\nAn individual with his Jupiter in the eleventh house is a natural organizer, having strong abilities in planning large events and activities. Such people may excel in jobs connected with the masses, no matter if it is concert planning, political campaign management, demonstration organization or anything else that involves large amounts of participants.\nIf you have this placement, lay back and enjoy. You probably will have a lot more easy-flowing life than many other individuals, as your problems may be frequently solved by other people – without even you requesting it. Even the hard periods of your life will be of a rather soft nature, as the care and love of your friends will heal most traumas quickly. Just keep in mind to not over-expand in friend matters. \n \n\n\nIndeed, maybe most people you meet are of the highest quality; yet it may be physically impossible to interact actively with an enormous amount of people.

The native observes the professional growth of the father, and the pleasure that he sees in his parent’s face becomes a motivation to achieve same things later in his life. In addition, the father has a very good reputation and is widely respected; this also later becomes a goal for the child to reach.\nThe individual with such a natal placement will follow exactly the same patter, creating a good reputation and being helped by authority figures to rise in power and prosper. He will be aided both by powerful businessmen and judges, and will have a rather good connection with the established religion and its priests. His activities may involve charities through religion or other ways of donating, which will furthermore improve the way that other people perceive him. \n \n\n\nJupiter in the tenth gives good abilities of leadership; on the other hand when such an individual receives a leading position he might indulge in procrastination. Especially an ill-aspected Jupiter will definitely contribute in capturing a prominent seat in some governmental or private company, and setting as a goal to work as less as possible. Jupiter in this natal placement can create the Golden Boy stereotype, waiting to cash in monthly checks full of bonuses for actually doing barely anything.\nIf the benefic planet is well aspected, then the individual will have excellent business ethics, and his generous and shining character will be just enough for his job. Career opportunities will arise just by his presence and people will strive to pull him into their business, as they feel an inner need to make him involved in their plans. A strong effect on such decisions can have his very good sense of humor which can blend greatly with serious business conversations and make him highly liked.\nPublicity can be gained easily and by luck, while Jupiter will guarantee that the native is chosen for promotion among a lot of others. The planet functions as a hook hanging from the heavens; even if the person does not target rising high in the structure and hierarchy of the company he works, life will still pull him up. Sometimes, this exact fact can even be the reason; the native is not obsessed with rising in higher positions and thus he is picked due to his wisdom and lack of pressure about such matters.\nAnother blessing that Jupiter grants when in the tenth, is actually choosing the career that suits you. A lot of people are forced to follow a different occupation than their dream job, but tenth house Jupiter individuals are not in this category! Keep in mind that such an attitude may take some time to get triggered and the native can actually understand what he really wants to do after his 30th birthday. Until that moment, Jupiter placed there can even grant him a rather relaxed life, as his family usually will have enough money. Instead, the native may travel some years to understand the world, concentrate on long-term studying and receive degrees and diplomas, without rushing to get into the working system. \n \n\n\nIf you have such a placement, there are really few things we can advise you. Just keep in mind to not over-do it with your self-confidence; Jupiter brings most of the times luck but it is the one time he does not, that he will screw you up! It is ok to risk some times, but if you risk all times it is definite that at least once you will fall. But, of course, Jupiter will help you rise again!\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:38'),
(1683, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-6th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nAs Jupiter is widely known to be the most benefic planet, its natal placement in the 6th house is a blessing for the native’s job matters. In addition, this is probably the best aspect for health; Jupiter is a shield against health problems and can give an great vitality.\nPeople who have their natal Jupiter in the 6th house actually love to work. Through working, they gain deep satisfaction and gratify themselves; it is their way of philosophical evolution. For them, it is very easy to find a new job and Jupiter usually gives a lot of them. Such a native will not be left unemployed for long; when he applies for a new position he will be granted it earlier than all the rest. Actually, the reason of him changing jobs might be only to find something better or to try experiencing a new position or work type. \n \n\n\nHe is a well-qualified and hard worker, which is noticed by his colleagues. They usually love him, as he has an exceptional work ethic system, by embracing the coworkers, helping them, teaching them and being fair to everyone. The managers always like him too because of his honesty and dedication. The result is that he becomes the bond between groups of people and a source of inspiration for everyone. Managers will strive to keep him in the company, as he is an example for the rest workers.\nIn his personal life, Jupiter’s placement in the 6th indicates a fondness of volunteering and altruistic offer towards the society. Such a person will frequently be associated with volunteering actions or communities, selflessly offering to others his time and care. He can himself be involved as a healer both of the mind and the body. If the native is a doctor, he might join the “Doctors without borders” or a similar organization. This placement is great for work as a medical, as the 6th house is also associated with asteroid Chiron and is responsible about health. As Jupiter is the ruler of the 9th house, there are possibilities of the native working abroad. This is not the general rule, but if Jupiter is supported by a trine from the 9th house then it is rather sure to happen.\nThe 6th house is also ruling the individual’s health and Jupiter acts protectively when placed inside. The native will be very healthy and energetic; nevertheless hard afflictions of Jupiter from Saturn or some other malefic can create problems that even a prominent Jupiter cannot protect from. As it is considered to be the planet of expansion, the health issues to whom it is connected involve the pattern of “too much of something”. Thus, any possible problems involve too much sugar in the blood, too much growth of cancer cells and so on. If you have this placement, such types of medical analyzes are a very good option every once and a while. Do not be afraid, though, it really takes to have very hard aspects so that Jupiter creates health problems. Your health will be probably very good during all your life, and will be a constant source of satisfaction. \n \n\n\nThe 6th house is not only ruling the native’s services to others, but also his own servants. With such a wonderful aspect, an individual will be always helped by others and treated well – you could even say that the karma that he creates from being of service returns back to him instantly.\nIn addition, Jupiter placed in the sixth house will give great joy through small animals; the native might have even a lot of pets in his house. Breeding animals as a job is also very favored, Jupiter will make this business prosper and the native highly satisfied with the career that he chose.\nThere are few things one can advice a person with such a positive 6th house aspect. We should probably just thank them from being a vital part of the society, sacrificing their own time and life for offering to the others. They probably learn this from the animals they keep at home! \n \n\n\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written.\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:43'),
(1684, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-5th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nAs always, Jupiter residing in a natal chart house brings very favorable effects to all matters ruled by the house. In this case, as the 5th house is connected with joy, children, love and sex, Jupiter’s presence will bring a great amount of happiness through everything that falls in this category. \n \n\n\nThe Grand Benefic can bring a lot of children, with the first of them having a rather strong Sagittarius/Jupiter emphasis in its natal chart. The native is very fond of children and will show a great deal of love towards them, also receiving a lot of affection back. He will adore playing with them and they really like his funny and warm character. Usually, the native as a parent figure will educate his children well, providing them also high philosophic views on ethics and morals, religion and the law. The children will develop a just and fair character, inspired by the native’s own example. \n \n\n\nJupiter in the fifth house expands the native’s creativity. Generally, if Jupiter is alone in the house, there might be a lot of procrastination and he will never become a great artists. If there are other planets also present, or Jupiter is receiving very positive aspects from Venus, Neptune or Uranus, he will be a lot more productive and invest his time in developing his self-expression into art. In case that the Sun or the Moon support Jupiter, there are possibilities of fame coming his way.\nFun is a very important priority in such a person’s life. Jupiter will give him a strong sense of humor, and draws him towards recreational activities that promote joy. This could be literally anything, from partying to sports, from gathering friends to visiting movies; everything that brings joy and laughter will play a strong role in his reality. \n \n\n\nJupiter in the 5th also likes gambling, and indeed can bring gains; especially if he is well-aspected. Good aspects for gambling are sextiles and trines to Venus and Uranus, especially if one of them is residing in the 2nd house. In addition, the same good luck will follow the native if his 2nd house cusp falls on Sagittarius. On the contrary, when Jupiter is adversely aspected by Mars, Uranus or Pluto, the native should be really careful with this passion. There might be some minor gains, but as Jupiter is the most expansive planet he will make this activity so frequent that will definitely create problems, even of losing properties. In case there is even one such harsh aspect to malefics, the best advice is to not indulge with gambling at all, because Jupiter can really overdo it with this matter.\nUnder the same rules fall all speculation business choices too. With Jupiter located in the 5th house, one can have great gains; on the other hand these gains can create a thirst of even more. This thirst can cloud the native’s mind, and when a transit triggers some dormant square aspect to a malefic he might lose a lot. So, always examine the natal condition of Jupiter in the 5th house before letting sheer luck decide on your wealth.\nThe love life of a person with Jupiter in the fifth house will be also very active. He will fall in love very times, change a lot of partners and choose depending on how much fun he has near a person. This planet does not give a lot of seriousness in his affairs; the native will adore flirting, will have a rather relaxed approach towards relationship and will indulge in a lot of casual sex. Jupiter gives an internal need to date a lot of people, but not becoming closely related. It is only after finding the correct person as a partner, that the priorities of the native change: The next step is having children, and probably a lot of them. Many times, the native concentrates fully on his children, forgetting to give the necessary love towards his partner.\nThis placement is one of the best a person can have, if joy is a priority in his life. He can be constantly discovering new levels of happiness, without ever getting bored of having fun. Natal Jupiter in the 5th house can make someone a real hedonist, the type that everyone wants to hang out with because he illuminates all the fun situations with his presence. The only thing you should guard from if you have this placement is concentrating on this aspect of your life so much, that you do not care about anything else than your serotonin and endorphin.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:46');

(1685, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-4th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nJupiter is known to be the grand benefic, illuminating any house it is natally placed. When it is positioned in the 4th house of a natal chart, it will generally bring a happy childhood in a large and prosperous family. As the 4th house is traditionally ruled by Cancer and the Moon, the mother will play a very important role in the native’s life, providing him with a lot of love and security. \n \n\n\nJupiter in the 4th house signifies a large family; there are possibilities of having a lot of siblings or living in a large house with a lot of family members; grandparents, uncles and aunts, cousins and even distant relatives. This placement usually gives a lot of wealth to the family, and brings an abundance of food; there is constantly something being cooked and offered at the table, and the whole family eats together in a happy atmosphere. \n \n\n\nWith such a Jupiter placement, the mother of the native is the archetype of “the provider”. She will cook and feed all the time, even force to eat but in a funny and gentle way. She might be rather fat but also funny, and maybe is the even the head of the family. Her character is strong and fair, while she will usually have a very strong Jupiter/Sagittarius emphasis in her natal chart. Usually, she will be somehow involved in religion and has a high-level perception of philosophy, even if it can be rather abstract. There is wisdom in her, and this will also pass to the native.\nThe overall childhood is a happy period for the chart owner; there is a lot of fun and playing, while the native observes his parents being happy and prosperous. Family as a term receives a rather positive color in the native’s mind; he will probably dream to continue the same pattern and create a large one himself. Jupiter is an expansive planet, and when natally located there will be pressing the native to expand his 4th house issues during all of his life. The native might want to make a lot of children, and will definitely strive to have a large house as the one in which he spent his early years. It is a very frequent phenomenon that this house will come as a heritage to him after his ancestors pass away. In addition, he can also inherit large parts of land; all the matters concerning real estate, land ownership, agriculture and mining will turn out favorable.\nOf course, as Jupiter is the planet of expansion his effect can have even an adverse nature. The native who has Jupiter in the 4th house can be a spoiled child, or be the favorite one among his parents and relatives. The wealth coming from the family might make him lazy, as he could even not need to work in his life because his parents will have provided him with everything needed. Such kind of people may have a big passive income from their early years, and simply live their life with the money that their wealth generates. Is that a bad thing? Of course not! Everyone wishes to be able to live such a life. The bad thing is that the native might spend his life caring too much about feeding his lower needs, without investing in his soul. In case he understands that there are more things in life than having a good time, then he will become really happy and evolve to a conscious being. And this is exactly what Jupiter wants, empowerment of the 9th house- the house of philosophy.\nWhen the native will energize his 9th house, and start concentrating on his spiritual evolution rather than his wealth, Jupiter will manifest in an even better way. Not only he will generate a more prosperous life, but also grant wonderful old years. The 4th house is responsible of one’s old age, and an active Jupiter will make the native receive all the benefits; his last years will be very pleasant. Jupiter gives also a possibility of getting involved in religion- or some other type of moral system/philosophy. \n \n\n\nGenerally, people with such a placement are advised to not change their residence location; they will not prosper anywhere else in the world as they would prosper in their birthplace. This, of course, happens if Jupiter is well-aspected. Most of the times though, the person with this natal Jupiter is rather complacent and has no desire to relocate somewhere far. After all, the leisure that his home conditions provide cannot be easily found elsewhere, and the mother’s food is also a main reason to stay.\nDo not forget to like and follow our Facebook Page and join the official Free-Spirited Mind forum to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:50'),
(1686, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-8th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nJupiter is the most benevolent planet, and wherever he is located is a blessing. When it is positioned in the 8th house, its positive and expansive energy affects the native’s sexual life. The 8th house is of the darkest in the native’s chart; responsible about his occult abilities, death and regeneration, inheritances and other people’s money. This placement can give tremendous powers in all these areas mentioned- and a lot more. \n \n\n\nPeople who have their natal Jupiter positioned in the house of death can benefit through anything connected with death, metaphorically or literally. Usually, this natal position brings big inheritances, which will pass to the native without any problems if there are no harsh aspects falling on the grand benefic. In case that there exist squares or oppositions, the native might experience delays or disputes during the process of receiving the inheritance. This mostly happens when Mercury or Saturn are involved with an adverse aspect. If the malefic involved is Mars, there can be aggressive circumstances and quarrels with other people about the heritage, while this is also a significator of spending the received wealth quickly or elsehow losing it.\nThe 8th house rules the marriage partner’s money, and such a placement definitely indicates a wealthy spouse. In addition, this placement helps in getting loans from banks or other individuals, as the 8th house rules other people’s money. In case that your Jupiter is well aspected, you should not worry about such kind of issues. On the contrary, if the aspects falling on it are difficult ones, be very careful. You will get the loan anyway, but you might not be able to return it, or you will spend it quickly and on things that you do not really need. An adversely aspected Jupiter can signify legal disputes and generally problems with the law, concerning money received from the bank, the government or another individual.\nNatives with Jupiter in the 8th house consider sex as a very important priority of their lives. They are very active sexually and reach high levels of pleasure. With certain partners their erotic life will be very spiritual, and the union of their bodies an everyday death and rebirth experience. This aspect makes sex be a lot more than just an activity: It is mysticism in its pure form. The two partners stop existing as separate beings during this act of union and transcend into oneness, being capable of entering the other realms together.\nOn the other hand, when the native does not have a stable partner, Jupiter will give him a lot of quality sex with various partners. As Jupiter is the planet of expansion, and if not obstructed he will expand beyond limits, it is wise to not overindulge into unnecessary activities. The problem with Jupiter is usually having “too much of something”, and the native should guard himself to not lose the magic of sex by spending too much energy and time on meaningless carnal pleasures. \n \n\n\nJupiter placed in the 8th house tends to give a strong interest in matters concerning life after death and the occult. The native will be highly intuitive, has psychic abilities and can excel in studying the forbidden and secret arts. The benefic planet brings protection from psychic attacks, high leveled perception of the meanings of life and death and a good glimpse of the greater picture. The native’s spiritual growth never stops and he obtains the status of the wise holder of secrets in the eyes of the other people. Such kind of people can even reach levels of losing any fear towards death and laugh at his grim face. \n \n\n\nAs the 8th house also rules the native’s own death, having the grand benefic placed inside signifies a peaceful and pleasant departure from this world. This usually happens due to natural causes, in the native’s favorite surroundings and rather late in life. His passage towards the other realms is harmonic, and he might even subconsciously understand when it will happen and get prepared for it.\nThis is an overall wonderful placement, in a house that can be considered of the most difficult in a natal chart. Most people are usually feeling uncomfortable with the 8th house issues, whether it is sexual taboos, the unknown, death or dealing with other people’s money. Jupiter here definitely helps in having a totally different approach to all these issues, which even by itself is life-altering. A person with such a natal Jupiter does not really need advice on these issues, except for the general suggestion to keep an eye on Jupiter in case of over-expansion.\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group to take part in conversations and frequently vote about next articles to be written\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:33:55'),

This is a particularly good natal placement, especially in women charts; they might make their dream of a wonderful marriage a reality. The same thing applies for men; nevertheless they might be more interesting in using this natal position for successful business partnerships. \n \n\n\nAs the 7th house is ruling the marriage in one’s natal chart, there will be definitely at least one marriage in the native’s life. Jupiter, as the planet of expansion, can even give multiple ones; this is more prominent when the planet resides in some bicorporal sign such as Gemini, Sagittarius or Pisces. The wife or husband might have strong Sagittarius characteristics or a very powerful Jupiter in his/her natal chart. The marriage partner is frequently wealthy or an authority figure, while sometimes can also be fatter/bigger than the average person. Usually, Jupiter in the 7th house gives a spouse with a good sense of humor, is kindhearted and helps the native a lot in all areas of his life.\nJupiter illuminates the whole life of the individual through bonding with their significant other. Usually, the marriage ceremony itself is phantasmagorical and a lot of money is spent on it. There will be a great number of people present, and the atmosphere will be utterly joyful. The spouse is usually religious or elsehow involved in the higher spheres of philosophy. If Jupiter is in Sagittarius or the 9th house cusp is located in this fiery sign, then the native will marry a partner from another country or a different cultural background\nJupiter in the 7th house is the best placement for becoming a negotiator. The person who has such a natal aspect has great diplomatic skills, managing to build bridges even between enemies. They also have the magical ability of turning their own enemies to friends, and turning them into rewarding relations for both. Their charm and smile can tear down most walls that other people build around them. This natal position of Jupiter is the best for co-operating with other people. It favors building business partnerships and can bring a lot of gains through contract or legal affairs in general.\nThe native’s profession can be strongly associated with some kind of mediation or lobbying, especially if Jupiter is connected with the 10th house or trining a planet placed in that house. This placement helps getting benefits from others without a lot of personal effort, just by being part of a structured business and having a passive role which generates income. \n \n\n\nAs Jupiter is ruling teachers, gurus or other influential figures, when it is located in the house of bonding there are possibilities of meeting such a mentor. The individual will be in a deep relation with him and receive a lot of inspiration for his personal evolution. Sometimes, this mentor will be the native’s spouse; in this occasion there will be tremendous admiration of him. The mentor figure will play a life-changing role in the native’s life and his benevolent and charitable character will have a permanent influence on the individual.\nJupiter in the 7th house will push the native to also get involved in charity; nevertheless the humanitarian offer to the society will not be done in person. Jupiter in the 7th house usually gives publicity in such benevolent actions, and most of the times through being a member of some type of organization, not through private initiative.\nAn overall great placement; the only thing that people who have it should take care of is not get into over-expenses for a wedding ceremony, or to not over-indulge in getting married a lot of times!

It is a very favorable position for one’s every day life, giving a lot of small pleasures and making the small moments interesting. Such a native will never get bored and will experience a lot of joy coming from his siblings and neighbors.\nAs the 3rd house rules intellect and communications, the native has a broad mind and is capable of speaking and writing well. These talents are usually not used for a profession, and people with such a placement just have them in an idle condition. They know about their abilities but are either lazy or uninterested in pressing themselves towards such a direction. Such kind of people love to talk, and will frequently pass long hours on the phone or texting friends through social media.\nThere is a tendency to love books and read plenty of them during their lifetime, as they enjoy learning till their old years. Their mind is a sponge which can easily absorb all type of information; nevertheless the third house usually brings a lot of useless data. The native should develop the correct filters to discriminate what he really needs and what not, because even if he has enormous capacity to remember things, the brain is not a garbage bin. Random and useless knowledge should be avoided, no matter if it strongly appeals him. If you have such a placement, stop opening 10 wikipedia tabs simultaneously and chaotically jumping from the one article to the other; it is better to concentrate on some important topic that will somehow aid you in your life.\nJupiter in the third house usually gives a lot of siblings, or cousins that behave like born brothers. The siblings are possible to have very strong Jupiterian aspects in their house or having their Sun in Sagittarius. The relations with them are very harmonious, reaching real unconditional love of the highest level. The third house also rules the neighbors; Jupiter brings a lot of kind-hearted people living near the native, and can develop stable and happy friendships that make neighbors act like brothers or sisters.\nThe siblings, the relatives and the neighbors can be involved in religion, law or higher education, and the time passed with them is usually full of interesting intellectual conversations where both natives gain from. People love hanging around with you and there is always a pleasant atmosphere in your social circles. You prefer to be with people that smile and laugh a lot, and this definitely mirrors back from you. \n \n\n\nAnother thing that the grand benefic influences while positioned in the third house is nearby travels. The native will frequently escape to short journeys, weekend trips or a country-house not far from his home, while also get involved in interesting activities and hobbies that he might have.\nThe childhood and school years of the native are sure to have been rather pleasant, unless Jupiter is very adversely aspected by a lot of planets. This position is generally giving a love for school and all the activities involved in it; the child adores learning, socializing and playing in the school. It is rather popular among other children, respected by teachers and taking good grades without struggling to learn. He might be even putting minimum effort, as his mind can drink the information provided in the lessons, without having to study at home. This can give them a lot of free time, which is used for playing and hanging out in the neighborhood. \n \n\n\nThere are no real disadvantages that can be created from this natal placement; the only thing that the native should be careful is overdoing with the third house issues. As Jupiter is the planet of expansion, he can literally have no limitations in how much he can expand the areas ruled by the house he resides in. It is great to have good neighbors, but you do not need your entire neighborhood present in your house every day!

I guess most of you came to read this article out of curiosity, about how the grand benefic planet of Jupiter functions when located in the house of possessions. And yes, the answer will not disappoint you (just maybe make you jealous, in case you do not have it!) \n \n\n\nWhen Jupiter resides in the 2nd house of a natal chart, it indeed grants luck with money. The native is probably born to a rather wealthy family, and from his young ages getting used to a life without financial problems. This placement favors all business affairs; from law to education, from religion to travel-connected jobs; other people can easily trust the native for working with him, and there can be great support from the government, the church or generally people in places of authority. There is great possibility of inheriting a family business, or being born to a famous judge, lawyer, politician etc; this way the career of the native might have been already decided from their father, but who said this is too bad when it comes with an already guaranteed success and accumulated wealth?\nOf course, as Jupiter adores to expand extravagantly every life area he touches, natives with such a placement are prone to spend without caring to track down where their money go. They are used to the fact that even if they spend everything, money will somehow appear again. And in most situations this is exactly what is happening!  The person is generous and has a rather luxurious style; a famous saying states that “money is attracted to money” and this is precisely the case. The native’s whole existence smells like prosperity, and even richer people strive to hang out with them. Also, the native’s personality radiates an aristocratic positivity, which is furthermore attracting people towards them. They are born optimists, prefer to spread good words and news around them and their smile during business can be their strongest weapon of success. \n \n\n\nAs Jupiter is ruling the 9th house, when he is present in the 2nd he just loves spending on higher education and travel. People with such a placement will not hesitate getting into huge expenses in these areas, which in the end expand their mind even more and have as a natural outcome to bring them even more money. Indeed, the 2nd house Jupiter person is not a silly spender; they have a deep and conscious approach toward what is worthy and what is not. In addition, such kind of people will invest huge amounts into their personal beliefs. This could be self-financing the publication of their own book, of their think-tank or anything else that carries their personal philosophic views. \n \n\n\nA curious fact is that Jupiter in the 2nd house produces wealth even if someone is lazy. It is a financial guardian angel, not allowing the individual to fall into poverty. On the other hand, procrastinating while having such a placement is of the most stupid things one can do! He might be losing an enormous opportunity to reach all his personal goals, throw in the garbage a gift from heavens that other people would sign contracts with the devil to have.\nAn issue such kind of natives should guard of, is overindulging in sweets, food and gaining a lot of weight. Be keeping themselves restrained and taming their appetite, they can manage to handle their Jupiter and hold him from expanding wherever he wants. This piece of advice is not just symbolical, there are sugar-connected diseases present out there such as diabetes, and Jupiter can overdo it with whatever he likes to consume.\nThere are no real dangers that Jupiter can bring through this placement. Having him in the 2nd house is even better than having Venus, as she is more prominent in spending without an apparent reason. Jupiter gives reasons, and contributes towards the inner evolution of the person. Spending makes them wiser, while they many times have the role of supporting other people through charities. This can be many times done secretly, so don’t judge quickly a second house Jupiter person just because you are jealous of his position!

(1690, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-9th-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nJupiter is the natural ruler of Sagittarius and the 9th house, thus when positioned there he feels at home and his power is enhanced. The 9th house rules philosophy, religion, law distant travels and benefits from foreigners, while is also responsible for all types of spiritual pursuits. Higher education, publishing and teaching also are issues of the 9th house, and when Jupiter is present there he will definitely lead the native towards a life of higher meanings and idealism. \n \n\n\nPeople who have Jupiter in their 9th house are passionate with traveling to new places; this usually broadens their mind and also triggers other matters governed by the 9th house. They adore learning and usually continue towards master or doctorate studies, while it is a frequent phenomenon that Jupiter shines back their effort towards other people, and they become professors or mentors of some kind. If Mercury is also present in the house, traveling comes together with learning new languages and generally adapting to a new culture and way of thinking. The more close their conjunction, the more possibilities exist for relocation to another country. Good luck follows the native in his journeys, and if no malefic is having an adverse aspect to Jupiter he should expect that all his travels will be troublefree.\nKnowledge is of high importance in their minds, and they prefer to broaden theirs in a wide sense, more than concentrating on a single detailed subject. For them, the big picture is more important even if it is more abstract. They self-educate during their whole life, which tends to become a hobby even if it is not necessary for them, as they usually reach success early in life.\nA lot of benefits can come through universities, people of spiritual power, law or the church. The native can influence the beliefs of the masses, and especially in his elder age he might engage in writing and publishing. Honesty is valued by them, and they strongly dislike hypocrisy. They have a natural curiosity, and sharing their discoveries and thoughts with other people can become a life target.\nIf the native’s Jupiter is at the end of the 9th house and conjunct the Midheaven, popularity is to be expected. The same can happen if Sagittarius occupies the 9th house and Midheaven also starts inside the sign, while conjunctions of Jupiter with the Sun, the Moon or Venus are also indicators of fame. He can easily became a leader and inspire other people; this is quite likely to happen when Jupiter trines Pluto or Mars, especially if they are located in the 1st house. In the first situation the native would be a man of politics and hierarchical power, while in the second situation his power and leadership would derive from military surroundings. \n \n\n\nJupiter in the 9th house is a wonderful position; yet there are also some difficult consequences deriving from it. The most frequent issue is the estrangement from friends and family due to traveling or studying abroad, and generally issues concerning friends and relatives. The native might have a big circle of acquaintances, yet he frequently does not dedicate to them the necessary time due to his long-term absence.\nIf the 9th house is occupied by Pisces, it is highly possible that the chart owner will follow the role of becoming a spiritual leader. In case there are also planets or a stellium occupying his 12th house, and aspecting Jupiter in the 9th, he might follow the road of being a monk or become a Hermit in some other way. When there are planets or a stellium in the 1st house, he would most likely be an extrovert figure in religion, far from self-imprisonment and hermetism.\nThe 9th house is responsible for publishing, writing, as long as import/export business. One should expect to get involved in publishing business either when a transiting slow moving planet as Pluto forms a trine with natal Jupiter, or when the Jupiter returns to his natal position. If Pluto is responsible for the entrance into the publishing world, then this change is permanent and publishing will be a part of the native’s reality for the rest of his life. Great success is to be expected, if there exist natal trine aspects to Jupiter from other planets, and transiting Pluto triggers them. \n \n\n\nThe 9th house Jupiter native tends also to find love abroad and marry foreigners. This has high possibility to happen if Jupiter is conjunct, trine or sextile Venus, or if the cusps of the 5th and 7th house are placed in Sagittarius. A person with Sagittarius at the cusp of the 7th house, Venus inside it and Jupiter in the 9th forming a sextile to Venus, is more than likely to marry a foreigner. Even if planets other than Venus are present in the 7thand form such an aspect, marriage and love tends to appear towards a person from a faraway place, or of great differences in language, customs, traditions or ethnicity. \n \n\n\nIn case that the 9th house Jupiter is very negatively aspected, the native might be sacrificing a lot of his personal small things at the altar of higher education. He might his entire life struggle to obtain knowledge, just to understand that he missed the opportunity to do the things he loves, to spend time with the people he loves. If the adverse aspect is a square with Pluto, the things that he sacrificed cannot return back, especially when a transiting planet triggers the square. Such kind of people usually face dilemmas of moving to another country and having to reject their past. This type of aspects could also signify relocation due to political instability or war in his country, and are by no means an easy choice as the relocation could be permanent.\nNevertheless, this is a rather extreme scenario. Jupiter in the 9th is one of the best placements that a native can have, and definitely positively affects the native’s life.

(1691, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-in-1st-house', 5, '\n \n \n\nHaving Jupiter in the 1st house is definitely beneficial, as the first house is the house of self and Jupiter is the considered the most beneficial planet. Which are the blessings it brings though? \n \n\n\nFirst of all, one must understand that the 1st house is also responsible for the body and not only for character. The ascendant in particular is to be responsible for the physical appearance, and thus any planet conjunct the ascendant or close to it is having influence on our looks. \n \n\n\nWhen Jupiter is residing near the ascendant, it tends to give beautiful and noble characteristics. Depending on which sign it is in, it tends to give beauty to the body parts that are ruled by that sign. If, for example, the first house contains Sagittarius, the person’s hands and legs tend to be long and well-shaped, as Sagittarius rules them.\nThe further from the ascendant, the more influence has Jupiter on internal characteristics and one’s attitude towards life. Usually a native with such a placement is jovial and smiling, with a great sense of humor. It creates the typical shining person that brings light to other people and attracts large companies of friends. Jupiter is the planet of expansion, so one should be careful of obesity problems – especially if the planet conjuncts the Ascendant. Being the planet of luck, it brings positive outcomes in difficult situations, narrow escapes from accidents, and is considered a savior angel. Of course, one must always have in mind that depending on luck is not to be practised, as it is the few situations that luck will not work that can bring a catastrophe. \n \n\n\nThe native should be very careful with his over-confidence, which can easily arise when he observes his general luck and sees that the chances are in his favor. It takes only one bad moment that Jupiter will not work as usual; to turn things upside down. Another problem that it could create is laziness and self-indulgence, especially when in square aspect with the Mid-heaven, which frequently happens when Jupiter is located in the middle of the first house. This might not be totally bad, as Jupiter there could signify an abundance of money and resources that could imply there is no actual need of work to survive and prosper.\nAnother thing someone must be careful of, is over-generosity. Jupiter gives a kind nature, always ready to help others, but by doing that all the time someone can get easily taken advantage of by the people around him, especially if Jupiter has a hard aspect with Neptune. Being the ruler of Sagittarius, it can make the person fond of philosophy, law, and religion, creating prominent and fair priests, governmental employees, and famous personas.\nLast but not least, this placement gives very high possibilities of good vitality, quick rehabilitation from sickness and disease, and a long and healthy life, especially when in good aspect with other personal planets. Born with Jupiter rising? Enjoy it, but always keep your feet to the ground! This is the safest way to have Jupiter shining throughout all your life without causing you problems. Always ask it to bring you “much,” but steer shy of asking for “too much”. Be careful for what you wish for!\nDo not forget to like our Facebook Page and join our Astrology Community Facebook Group, where you can take part in conversations and vote about next articles to be written!\n\n \n \n\n ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-16 23:34:20'),

You are strongly tempted to preach to people who are in error, and you may do this at times. But then everyone will watch you to see what kinds of mistakes you make. If you can be more humble and realize that you do not have all the answers, you can convert the negative elements of this aspect to a very positive energy. Others will feel very good about you, knowing they can trust you to do whatever is right and necessary in a situation. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n                      <br />\r\n<br />\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 02:51:34'),

The source of these may be sentimental attachments to the past, to memories, to experiences, and to earlier relationships. You find it difficult to break free from the past; and previous experiences will influence present choices and attitudes. You may have grown up with a negative self-image, one which lessens self-confidence and also shapes restrictive worldviews. This may come from unsettling and disturbing childhood experiences. Perhaps you put up protective barriers to defend vulnerable feelings from damage; you may have believed you were not loved by your parents, or you were left with just one parent through separation, divorce, or death. Issues of emotional dependency may have grown, and a mother- or father-complex formed, making it difficult to cut the parental umbilical cord when you became an adult. You tend toward pessimistic attitudes, linked to a reduced physical vitality, emotional moodiness, melancholic dissatisfaction, and depression. Lacking self-confidence and perhaps seeing the world as a harsh, loveless place, you may feel bitter and cynical, preferring isolation from relationship intimacy. Family ties bind you. This could suggest that you are older than most when you leave home to become independent; or you could have the onerous duty of caring for an elderly parent. Your family life may turn into an imprisoning environment in some way, perhaps through children, economic hardship, or social isolation. You maintain tensions and frustrations by refusing to release behaviour patterns formed during childhood and within your parental relationship. It is your choice, if you wish, to continue limiting your life, but it is not inevitable; limitations are only imaginary parameters which we draw around ourselves as a barrier; they can be erased or expanded. Your creativity is blocked by emotional repression. If you dissolve the barrier and redirect the energies toward positive and constructive channels, then much could be achieved. Finding additional interests and stimulation would be beneficial, showing that the world has much o offer if you open to its riches. Becoming involved with children could reveal new ways to see things; their enthusiasms and sense of wonder could be transmitted to you. With contemporary self-help techniques, visualization, meditation, affirmation, and the availability of numerous ways to release blocked energies, you can transform your life to face the future with positivist and optimism.

Ambition is likely to be a powerful motivating force within your personality, and, once your aims have been clarified, careful planning and application can help you to achieve them. Persistence and hard work may be the keys to later success, and it is unlikely that progress will be swift or aims realized at an early age. As Saturn implies limitations and barriers, it is probable that even when following your solar path there will be obstacles and frustrations confronting you, and there may be periods when you begin to feel the inhibitions of your nature and path acutely. You can lack sufficient confidence, adopting a self-deprecating attitude as justifying any lack of progress. Temperamentally, you are serious and reserved, often taciturn in expression, controlled and disciplined and viewing life with an uneasy attitude. To you, life demands effort and application, and nothing comes easy or free. So you believe that to become materially comfortable you may have to deny certain feelings or needs in order to concentrate and focus on your aims. Unfortunately, through self-denial and austere attitudes, you may repress self-expression, creating inner imbalances which have later negative side-effects. These could become more predominant if you enter a phase of frustrations, where disappointments generate tensions, stresses, angry thoughts and emotional attitudes. Disorders of the digestive system may be associated with this, and you may need to increase relaxation in your life, perhaps by consciously dismantling any fixity of lifestyle and daily habit patterns that may be unconsciously erected around yourself as a form of protective barrier. The house position of the conjunction is a sphere of opportunity and of limitation for you, depending on the inner changes that you can consciously make. Success can result from applying your strengths, which are likely to be in areas of organization, self-reliance, discipline, persistence and determined application. The theme of consolidation and building is associated with this aspect, where existing resources are used in ways which take greater advantage of their potential, expanding from a secure foundation but not overly risky or speculative. Careers in management, politics, law, scientific research, teaching, local government may be attractive, especially if you are able to use an ability to assume responsibility within your employment. Your earlier childhood development will have been influenced by the relationship to your father. Look at the attitudes towards life that your parents expressed, and see if these have become your dominating attitudes and values too. You may have received a highly ordered and strict parental discipline, encouraging conformity to parental desires and codes of conduct; moralistic or religious attitudes may have conditioned your worldview. There may have been a lack of parental approval or response to your unique childhood nature, perhaps a lack of emotional affinity (perceived or actual) which made you feel more isolated and independent; certainly you would have experienced an early inner maturation process. Have you become what your parents wanted you to be? And is this in accordance with your desires and dreams? You may need to break free from these earlier psychological programs that are still operating in you, so that you can move in new directions or transcend those restrictions in life that are acting as barriers to fulfillment and success. You have much of value to share with the world, but this may need greater releasing. For instance, you may feel that everyone makes their own destiny (and certainly, to some degree this is correct), but this should not stop you being generous if you have financial abundance in your life; you could help others to help themselves. There may be a belief that there is a lesson or message within every life experience, but this should never stop feelings of love and friendliness flowing out naturally from you to others. Acknowledging others in a different way may be necessary, so that you are more aware of their needs and qualities, and this can divert you from your self-preoccupations. Certainly you will require a compatible intimate partner who recognizes your need for achievement, and who is willing to support your endeavors; but equally, you should not forget that your partner also has their own life path to follow, and you should not forget their needs either.

Being unaware of these tendencies is no excuse; failing to acknowledge that others have an equal sensitivity is a denial of reality. If you react against criticism, then so do others from you. You need to realize that others'' needs are as important as yours. Compromise between all concerned is necessary to minimize conflicts. Emotional reactions distort your perceptions and evaluations, influencing choices, decisions, and actions; and sometimes these may contradict rationality. This apparently negative portrayal of Moon-Mars conjunctions can, however, be transformed into a more positive approach. Much depends on an honest appraisal of your relationships, and of how you deal with inner difficulties, especially identifying how you project emotional frustrations onto others close to you, making these relationships fail to satisfy and later collapse. These intense feelings can be directed toward positive aims designed to shape constructive action. If you consciously attempt - even for a short time - to project yourself into the position of others and to imagine how life is from their perspective by seeing through their eyes and feeling through their heart, then your egocentric world may be transformed, and your latent sympathy and understanding awakened. Moon and Mars can work successfully together, once inner adjustments are made; and feelings of personal anguish and frustration are reduced by developing awareness of others'' needs. Then you may discover a new meaning and purpose to life. There can be a crusading spirit about this energy supported by powerful, assertive Martian qualities, which can increase persistence and opportunities for eventual success. This could initiate a real transformation. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 03:44:31'),

The close conjunction of Moon and Mercury suggests a relatively open channel between your unconscious mind and your rational mind; exactly how this relationship works may, however, be variable, with both the strengths and weaknesses of each planet displayed over time. Rationality assumes higher priority; and possible conflict may revolve around times when lunar messages contradict Mercury messages.

You can benefit from formal study, as you are able to absorb information relatively easily; but the ideal type of study is one which also involves a positive emotional response, so that the Moon is also included. The main challenge is to unite both Moon and Mercury qualities consistently so co-operation results, and not conflict. You need to distinguish between opposing inner messages, identifying those associated with the Moon - habitual security, instinctual and emotional patterns - and those which the Mercury-influenced logical mind presents. These messages can be either complementary or conflicting; and to evaluate which requires your self-understanding.

Your social relationships can lack spontaneity, enthusiasm, and naturalness, inhibited by emotional defensiveness, reserve, and caution. Self-esteem is weakened by such attitudes, which fall like a shadow across your relationships and experiences. One source of this may have been childhood and early social conditioning. Perhaps early childhood was influenced by family discipline, either through authoritarian controls, or through imposed religious, political, or social beliefs. Perhaps there were family upheavals and unsettling discord, or strong feelings that you were not really wanted or loved by your parents, whether or not this was actually true. This may have resulted in a fear of emotional expression, to others and even to yourself. This, coupled with a need to protect your sensitivity, has associated emotions with painful ''negative experiences''. In adult life, there may be one parent toward whom you still feel resentment, deeply contradictory attitudes, and powerful emotions. Emotional integration can be lacking; it is part of your nature that remains uncomfortable and relatively immature, and which will interfere with adult relationships that may prove difficult to develop beyond the early stages.

This can create duality and friction between ''head and heart'', which may be difficult to resolve. Emotionally, you may experience regular mood changes and erratic, contradictory feelings, appearing to others as unpredictable, unreliable, impulsive, or lacking in commitment and responsibility. Lunar energies fluctuate, ebb and flow; and joining these with Uranus is not conducive to a stable and controllable inner life. You will find that your ''inner bias'' moves between either lunar dominance or Uranus dominance; only occasionally will it rest at a balance uniting both. However, when ''head and heart'' are in accord, this is the ideal state, and achieving this should be an objective more regularly. You look for the unusual and the exciting in life. Strangeness and novelty intrigue and attract you; and this influences your intimate relationship choices. Your Moon will demand the experience of intense emotions; and Uranus will expect fascinating and excitement to bewitch the mind.

You hate others resisting your will; and when this happens, you respond with a personal attack. Sometimes such an antagonistic stance may succeed; but eventually its costs far exceed those of other more moderate approaches. Yet your personality can appear attractive to many; and there is certainly a validity that can intrigue some, even though it is often a distorted expression of the planetary energies. Choosing companions, both friends and lovers, is one area where weaknesses may appear, as you are often attracted to people who turn out to be unsuitable characters with equally volatile emotional difficulties.

You tend to look for the solutions to your problems in the outer world, often by forms of dependency on others, or by misidentification with people, places or material possessions which seem to offer some sense of security and respite from those inner pressures of emotional confusion. By doing this, you are liable to fragment an already fragile emotional nature, and by displacing your centre you are liable to suffer a loss of motivational and directional cohesiveness to your life. As is common with these planetary contacts, there is an over-imaginative production of illusions, where the boundaries of truth and fiction become blurred at the edges. It is within your more personal and intimate relationships that these illusions are probably most active and observable, especially as they tend to create distortions, disorder and confusion in communication. At times you may feel trapped within your lifestyle, aching to become free of any situations that you feel are oppressing you. You often respond to such feelings by attempts at escapism, tending to prefer ''running away'' from problems rather than confronting them in an effort to resolve them. This psychic emotional sensitivity and empathy to people and environments tends to be very influential, and you tend to absorb all impressions without any protection or discrimination. Underlying the emotional vulnerability and lack of confidence is a reservoir of creative talent that can be used; the difficulty lies in being able to clear a path for it to flow through into manifestation, and to do so requires the transformation of inhibiting emotional patterns. If you seriously choose to apply yourself, then perhaps through disciplined training and tuition you could unlock the closed doors to this inner imaginative talent and release that frustrated energy.  Self-confidence will improve as each small step is taken and you begin to observe the improvements that are happening, and slowly you''ll believe that you can exploit that reservoir of hidden potential that is so deeply located within you. You''ll start to reclarify your aims and intentions in life, piecing together a new direction to travel, forging a lifestyle that fits you and which does not generate friction through inner frustration and conflict. Relationships will improve as clarity depends through more realistic appraisals and understanding, plus the awareness to make essential compromises and adjustment to live harmoniously with a partner.\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 03:47:47'),

This tension and pressure can make it difficult for others to relax in your company. Relationships are uneasy, and are not helped by your suspicion of others. You rarely allow access into the sanctum of your personal life, so this distancing suits you. Domestically, you dislike intrusion, and take offence whenever anyone is patronising or attempts to dictate to you. You can find consistency difficult in intimate relationships; not in the sense of loving, but more in how you express feelings. This is due to emotional blockages and control needs; you may appear to ''blow hot and cold'' to your partner; yet this simply reflects how your emotional world is at any given time, rather than indicating the depth of love you feel for your partner. You will be emotionally sensitive, and feel really hurt when another does not respond to your advances; you have a low threshold for emotional pain, which amplifies mood swings.

(1832, 0, 'us', 'moon-opposition-saturn', 7, 'It is probable that the restrictions and limitations which you encounter are mainly derived from other people or environmental pressures, and that relationship difficulties will occur. Childhood experiences and parental or social conditioning will have greatly affected you; and your attitudes and worldview are likely to have been molded by duty, obligation, and responsibility. You see their requirements as necessary for the socially mature individual, but, instead of gradually developing as a result of real maturation, these have been imposed on you, probably during childhood before you were able to properly integrate them. Parental pressure or environmental circumstances may have forced you to ''act grown up'' before you were ready, having to conform to these demands. You may have reacted against the discipline of restraining attitudes and imposed rigid behaviour, and may have seen your parents as lacking love or understanding for you. Life presents a vista of duty and obligation; it is viewed as a serious affair in which ''doing the right thing'' becomes important, even if this means ignoring your feelings, instincts, and emotions... or so it seems to you. One result could have been a controlling of childhood feelings, exuberance, and enthusiasm, of not being allowed time for childish play and ''silliness'', acting out imaginative fantasies, or refusing to conform. By adult life, this may have consequences of moodiness, bleak depressions, and negativity. You may display emotional inflexibility, endure phases of stagnation, and have fears of people, experiences, and situations. If this occurs, it is symptomatic of unconscious emotional repression, which now influences your everyday consciousness and reality through interference. Sensing this repression, others may avoid closeness with you, as they sense that your social stiffness inhibits relationships; as your vibration is that of a loner, they may feel uncomfortable. Negative attitudes can become restrictive and limiting; opportunities can be lost through refusing to take chances, or relationships denied through social unease or fear of emotional intimacy. If you can redirect your attitudes in a more positive and constructive direction, things will open up; making such a shift is likely to prove difficult, yet, if achieved, will be highly rewarding. Clarifying your life direction is important, enabling energies to be targeted at achieving specific personal aims. While the ''duty and obligation'' program dominates you, there can be antagonism toward authority figures such as employers or managers, especially if they provoke your feelings or wound your sensitivity. If you chose not to become self-employed, then work related to medicine, research, social welfare, community service, law, or government may attract. Relationships can prove problematic. You find difficulty letting down your emotional drawbridge to others, and struggle to express feelings. Sometimes embryonic relationships are destroyed by your allowing previous relationship experiences to interfere, by prejudging people according to past disillusionments. Emotions are protected; and this can prevent intimacy from developing. Older partners may attract, as may those who display a maturity which you believe you lack. Be careful of becoming dependent on others. It may be inevitable that you fall in love with someone who displays affection but not love for you. This leaves you emotionally vulnerable; and powerful but painful feelings are encountered. Such experiences could prove uncomfortable and traumatic, yet releasing emotions is the healthiest action. If a relationship develops, then you may become less defensive, and your hidden potential may unfold with a loving partner. Children may help to open you, providing a relationship into which you can pour love, helping you to feel at ease with displaying feelings in a less threatening context. You may find that family obligations create limitations, due to financial constraints and parenting responsibilities. A balanced approach to fulfilling responsibilities in a more relaxed, emotionally responsive manner is required; and much depends on transforming attitudes and feelings. If this is achieved, limitations will progressively dissolve as emotional stress is released, and a new feeling of liberation grows. With emotional freedom comes the dismantling of those inner barriers which have prohibited creativity and imagination; and taking these steps may reveal previously unexplored and unrecognized talents and abilities. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 03:48:08'),

These will reflect the clash between old and new, between familiar behaviour patterns and the attraction of renewal emerging from a chaotic unknown. Your inner life may feel like a battleground, as these two different energies try to influence choices and decisions; and at times of crisis, you may feel almost torn apart. A tendency toward mental and emotional stress will exist, arising from emotional instability and problems created in relationships through unpredictable and frequent mood changes. The impact of the Uranian vibration may create sudden changes in the erratic mutability of the lunar emotions. This can stir choppy seas into more dangerous storms. If you then release this tension through conflict with those closest to you - which is a common behaviour pattern - relationships could become quite stormy. Others'' inability to rely upon and trust you will obviously affect the development of long-term relationships. Your need for variety can also cause problems. This can be felt inwardly, where you easily get bored and lose interest in your home, employment, marriage, lovers etc., and then enter a phase of frustration if your need for new stimulation is denied. To break free from this tension, you may suddenly ''explode'' toward new explorations, attempting to shatter all limitations and restrictions. This can lead to moving to a new house, changing employment or established careers to pursue other directions, or entering affairs or separating from marriage. You find responsibility and commitments hard to bear during times when the Uranian impulse is too strong and capable of breaking through the Moon''s established defensive patterns. What should be avoided is a repressive build-up of inner tensions, because if they ''explode'' through you, their destructive quality will dominate, rather than their transformative intent. The first step lies in acknowledging this inner pressure, and then learning to release it slowly and with conscious control, directing it into suitable channels as a natural development of your life. Accepting this impulse for new experiences and interests can be adequately handled, if a continuous element of exploration in your life is sensibly allowed to operate in appropriate ways. This is and essential ''safety valve'' to develop for your well-being. Understanding this tendency will help in choosing a suitable partner, one who accepts this need of yours and is both capable and willing to compromise when necessary in helping you to find ways to safely release tensions. Any progress made in integrating your emotions and mind into a functioning whole will reap considerable dividends. Self-help techniques devoted to personal wholeness could be explored, offering potential positive development. Attempts by you to impose either emotional or rational dominance on your inner life will lead to additional friction created by the ignored planetary energy. Feelings of instability that often persist also diminish your self-esteem, resulting in insecurity. You may lack a firm personality centre, fluctuating between Moon and Uranus, between emotion and logic, finding a home nowhere. You could find it useful to experience your emotional depths as deeply as possible. Let them rise to the surface; feel and understand their intensity, without cutting them off whenever they become unpleasant by an ''intellectual put-down'' as inferior and not part of your preferred self-image. Equally, your mental interests and pursuits should be emotionally resonant, drawing both levels together. As your nervous system is over amplified, attempts like these help moderate and balance the flow of combined energies, thus making it easier for you to live with others without frequently feeling a restless obsession for change.\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 03:48:16'),

You may feel emotionally blocked in dealing with others, and uneasy in social company. This may be a pattern persisting since childhood, when you may have felt unloved and misunderstood by your parents, especially your mother. You have a tendency to feel unloved; and this insecurity is communicated in subtle ways to others, who may sense that you are ''hiding something''; this, in turn, casts doubt on your sincerity. As distance enters your relationships, your negative feelings and fears of being disliked are reinforced, and the cycle perpetuates itself. Because vitalizing and harmonizing feelings are inwardly blocked, they fail to enter your social relationships. People may perceive you as cold, unfriendly, or distant, and find it too much effort to spend time and energy slowly getting to know you. Your attempts to share and communicate are erratic, often superficial, and lack a recognizable warmth. Even when you are admiring someone''s achievements or making gestures of appreciation, there can be an unconvincing delivery, as though you are going through socially acceptable motions but not putting any heart into it. AS you know, this isn''t the truth; but the inability to communicate your sensitive emotional nature to others creates a misleading impression of your character. You may make compensatory attempts to avoid confronting your emotional unfulfillment; and these can include a preoccupation with material possessions, money, and comforts. You may attempt to form an identity and self-worth founded on physical acquisitions, or through a life-style which reflects Venusian tendencies toward sensuality and luxury. despite your need for closeness, it is your unconscious behavior which pushes people away. Inner barriers need dismantling; and moving beyond your inhibiting patterns requires some risks and overcoming security needs. Be open to contact; be more friendly and less distant; share yourself more easily; drop expectations about people; be less judgemental. Try to relate intellectually rather than just emotionally, because your emotions still need cleansing and healing before their agitative vibration becomes more settled. Learn how to co-operate better by making effective adjustments and mutual concessions. The likelihood is that, over time, the quality of your relationships will improve, enabling blocked emotional energies to be released gradually and safely, as you feel able to open to a new type of contact with people and the environment.

Your temper can flare at such times; and, if emotional pressure builds inside, you can become argumentative just for an excuse to release blocked energy; yet, once the energy has flowed outward and the pressure diminishes, you feel much better - the question is, how much damage have you done? While the Martian energies encourage spontaneous, impulsive actions, the protective lunar instincts tend to pull you back, allowing time to think and re-evaluate your decisions; this usually prevents rash actions which may have detrimental consequences. Often though, the directions of your feelings and your willful actions synchronize well, co-operating to make aims achievable. One valuable asset is the temporary lunar block on impulsive action which ensures that you think before leaping.

You will be very responsive to the dimension of social relationships, obligations and service, and this could form the key foundation in your life, both in providing a sphere of employment and as one which allows your intrinsic talents and qualities to emerge. You have a heart response to negative social conditions, whether in terms of individuals, alienated minority groupings or global undifferentiated sympathies. This may attract you towards employment which involves you in dealing with social-problem areas, or at least towards associating with pressure groups concerned with areas of social deprivation and negativity. You can become quite passionate in denouncing man''s lack of humanity and care for others, and feel concerned enough to add your support to more positive and beneficial causes. You tend to be externally focused rather than inwardly preoccupied, and this can lead you to become a spokesperson for your social objections, attempting to wake the public up to those dangers or lack of care that so offend you as causing people to suffer unnecessarily.. This search to promote social remedies can help you to express your creative spirit through evocative writing, through the dissemination of relevant information such as an educational aid; some may feel drawn to crusading journalism designed to awaken the sleeping social conscience. Having high social ideals implies that one important role that you could perform is as a mediator and enunciator of proposed social progress and development. Working with the burdens of social welfare in some respect would give deep satisfaction, as through your heart response you create alternative suggestions for improvement transmitted via your inspired intellect. You are less prone to illusions and pedestal building in your intimate relationships, as you should have a more realistic appraisal of the fallibility of human nature, and your tolerance and understanding should lead you to less disappointment in this area. Provided that you create the right channels for external activity, then both your domestic and social life should fulfill. Try not to forget that the Moon will anchor you in deep family ties, both to your parents and to any current family, and that these are probably more important to you than you may realize, especially if you become extremely involved in social action.

Your inner life and imagination can often indicate suitable directions for you to travel in, or even themes for social action, and probably many of your decisions are taken by acting on your more unconscious impulses.

While you recognize that you do not have all the answers, you realize striving to understand helps to build bridges - whether within yourself or to others - and so you value the act of listening and are ready to talk about problems with friends or partners for mutual sup0port and benefit.

Yet others turn toward you for support, not necessarily because they believe you have the answers, but because they recognize that you will honor and acknowledge their pain and confusion. In that mutual recognition a form of supportive healing and acceptance can be transmitted. You apply an intelligent approach to life, founded on common sense and personal integrity. You will demonstrate efficiency, practicality, pragmatism, and order in whatever tasks you undertake, and will be relied on to perform in an organized manner in accordance with standard procedures. You work well within traditional workplaces where established operational structures exist and conformity to them is expected; this satisfies the Saturn expectations. Attractions to law, medicine, politics, management, local government, and education are likely. There may be financial skills which can be exploited, especially through business endeavors.

Close friendships and trust are important; and you favor a small, select group of confidantes linked also by emotional connections, mutual care, and concern. For a permanent partner, you want someone capable of relating deeply on every level - physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. Your ideal relationship encourages mutual development, as both partners help each other; this becomes a creative interdependence. You must not deny feelings, instincts, and emotions, especially when mental preoccupation is more emphasized and active. Feelings are important; and, while remaining vulnerable to their reactions, you would be unwise to ignore their messages.

You prefer to share and talk through any individual or relationship difficulties, as this creates clarity and mutual understanding. Your genuine loving concern for partners builds a foundation which is secure enough to withstand passing storms.

For example, you may possess creative ability, yet fail to demonstrate this tangibly due to not making sufficient effort to develop latent talents. You tend to resist hard work, and can display a lazy, apathetic attitude at times, especially if you have little interest in the work to be done. You may believe that life should be easy, with few worries, allowing you to be self-indulgent. This attitude may have grown from your parents who served and overindulged you, or made you feel special and perhaps encouraged a belief that the world would take care of you. You react to the world through powerful emotions which condition perceptions and evaluations of experiences. As you prefer to follow instincts and emotional messages, you may be reluctant to listen to your intellect. Adopting such an approach may not always work to your advantage; and, over time, you may realize that relying on emotional responses alone may prejudice actions, choices, and decisions, often leading you in unsuitable directions that might have been avoided if you had taken a more rational approach. As emotions can wax and wane, consistency may be lacking in your attitudes and relationships. Limitations may be self-created if you listen only to your feelings. While they can provide a good guide at times, their reactions are not always suited to every choice; and more time spent in careful thought and consideration could be useful for your future. A tendency to make impulsive and emotional decisions needs to be superseded by deliberate planning; rushing to satisfy immediate desires may later be regretted. You may require more realistic attitudes, both with people and in dealing with the world. Sometimes you can project overly optimistic emotions into relationships, feeling that this is ''the greatest love of all time''. Or genuine generosity may leave you financially bankrupt, perhaps through extravagance, lending to the wrong people, or just a lack of financial acumen. Be extremely careful not to overestimate business prospects. You may benefit from receiving expert financial advice, although even then discrimination is needed to avoid choosing the wrong type of advisor. Intimate and social relationships may be erratic at times, as you can fluctuate between extroverted moods and introspection, depending on the relative strengths of either Jupiter or Moon. With an independent spirit, you may often feel you do not need much social contact, and so friendships may become characterized by infrequent contact, indifference, and fickleness at times. You will do your own thing, either with complete enthusiasm and temporary commitment, or by slipping into apathetic disinterest. These fluctuating tendencies can be changed if you choose to do so. The approach needed is one of self-determination and concentrated application, once you decide on a suitable direction that offers potential for greater meaning and purpose. In your early life, you may not have been particularly ambitious, preferring freedom, acting with little responsibility, and moving in and out of situations and relationships as it pleased you, directed by your inner emotional pendulum. This could have been a phase of wandering and exploration, lacking any distinct aim. This phase may continue with varying emphasis until you face the need for responsibility in life, perhaps encountered through settling into marriage, financial commitments, and the raising of a family. Having to ''shape up'' may shock you into several realizations. You may make greater efforts to make life stimulating, preventing it from becoming staid and restrictive, and realize that planning and organization can make routines flow more smoothly, with less conflict and fewer painful experiences. Social awareness may deepen, as you become less self-preoccupied; any tendencies toward extravagant fantasies are modified as you recognize the limitations of real life. When reality intrudes, illusions should dissipate; if they persist, then reality is being ignored and evasiveness will exact its own price later.

Conscious change is required to overcome conflict between your conscious mind and protective lunar habit patterns. One likely imbalance is an unconscious lunar domination of your rational mind, where thought processes are subverted by deep emotions and feelings, with a consequence that decisions, judgments, or objective evaluation are influenced by emotionally charged attitudes. Such unconscious attitudes and values - possibly absorbed during early childhood or from parents - can condition present choices, where issues of the past still dominate your current life. Simply put, head and heart can be in constant conflict within you; decisions may be made according to which is dominant at any given time. This temporary supremacy can vary, like a pendulum movement, and may also be related to the sign, house, and element that each planet is in. It may be that one planet consistently dominates, and the other one becomes repressed. If Mercury dominates, then the Moon activity can sink deeper into the unconscious mind, influencing you more subtly and pervasively from a hidden position where the emotional coloration is less noticeable to you than to others. If Mercury is repressed, then rationality and logic may diminish, and choices may be influenced by insistent emotions, instincts, and feelings; habit patterns may often be security-biased. Sometimes you may observe that, when attempting to restore inner balance, Mercury begins to excessively rationalize feelings and emotions. If this is allowed to persist, you may start to deny the validity of your emotions and feelings, and in so doing repress your Moon sensitivity, creating another imbalance. Inner tension can reflect insecurity and self-doubt, creating highly nervous activity prompted by disharmony between the personality''s conscious and unconscious levels. Sometimes this can manifest as psychosomatic illness, especially nervous illness, digestive problems, and diseases related to the activity of body fluids. Another problem could emerge from self-centeredness and separative ways of living and expression. You may rely on fixed attitudes, thoughts, beliefs, and values for a sense of stable security; but these can also create relationship difficulties if you act inflexibly. Whenever someone else''s opinion differs from yours, you may react with aggressive defensiveness, without first considering the value of another point of view. You hate suggestions from others that you may be wrong, as this makes you feel insecure. Your response to this is often defiant and compulsively assertive. Paranoid feelings often accompany this reaction; and you can be very touchy emotionally, often triggering off misunderstandings and communication breakdown. With strangers you always feel insecure and on the defensive; even with closer friends, acquaintances, and family this pattern persists, although with les belligerence. Yet even in the family home, you react against having to change to accommodate others. Self-centeredly, you believe they should change to suit you;; the fact that they may not wish to do so is apparently of little concern to you. Yet you can often communicate quite well with those with whom you feel safe, often revealing a touching if slightly immature and sentimental emotionality about such relationships. Your hidden dependency on such intimates may not always be realized or acknowledged. Relationships would improve if you were less self-preoccupied, seeing others'' needs as being as important as your own, and giving to others what you are so busy taking for yourself. Attention needs to be directed externally for you to become aware that others have equal needs and difficulties. Through mutual support, all can benefit and have a more enjoyable life. Sometimes your needs and concerns can become obsessive; and you rarely see that this represents immaturity and lack of integration. Ways that you evade making necessary inner changes can include obsessions with trivia and matters of inconsequence, continual chatter, which can create unsatisfactory relationships and wastes energy instead of using it positively to change internal stress through self-understanding. Mercury is often repressed by a dominant Moon whenever issues of personal security dominate life, much like a demanding infant wanting immediate satisfaction. Because of this, you can lack rationality and objectivity, as noted in signs of immaturity, a lack of self-understanding, and a surfeit of emotional bias. Sometimes your ability to discriminate between reality and illusion, fact and fiction, is weak.

Attempts to warp realities, especially those concerning others, are never welcomed and are a source of conflict within relationships. Insisting that you are right - even against the recall of several others - will eventually generate antagonism, as no-one enjoys having their reality and memory threatened by others, even if they are family members.

Types of body work, manipulation and massage could possibly be additionally beneficial too.

At least you know the past; the future sometimes scares you, stirring uneasy feelings, especially as this cannot be controlled. You may find difficulty dealing with powerful feelings of destructive energy, an urge to smash and break down obstacles that prevent you from enjoying freedom. This inner state generates tensions and pressures which you control and repress, afraid that, if unleashed at an appropriate time, much damage could be caused. It can be hard for others to understand how this sensation of destructive emotional energy shapes and restricts you. You also find it difficult to discover how to release this energy constructively; but it is essential that relationship conflicts be reduced. You may often force issues, releasing this energy in confrontations which create sudden and dramatic life changes, despite intending this simply to release inner pressures which increase whenever you feel as if you are not in control. Your tendency is to explode - or to implode - to stimulate a necessary transformation that can create space for changes to occur. You need to trust more - your family, intimate partners, and others. Try to communicate your feelings and difficulties so that others can help you to release them less abrasively. Compromise is essential; the world does not revolve around your needs and desires, and living together requires mutual benefit and support. Redirecting self-preoccupation toward helping others could become a way for emotional intensity to flow safely outward, reducing inner pressure. A deeper self-understanding, perhaps through courses and study in psychology, occultism, meditation, and self-exploration, would benefit you considerably, and give insight into the energies and levels of consciousness which create the complexity of the human personality.\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 03:52:05'),

The source of these may be sentimental attachments to the past, to memories, to experiences, and to earlier relationships. You find it difficult to break free from the past; and previous experiences will influence present choices and attitudes. You may have grown up with a negative self-image, one which lessens self-confidence and also shapes restrictive worldviews. This may come from unsettling and disturbing childhood experiences. Perhaps you put up protective barriers to defend vulnerable feelings from damage; you may have believed you were not loved by your parents, or you were left with just one parent through separation, divorce, or death. Issues of emotional dependency may have grown, and a mother- or father-complex formed, making it difficult to cut the parental umbilical cord when you became an adult. You tend toward pessimistic attitudes, linked to a reduced physical vitality, emotional moodiness, melancholic dissatisfaction, and depression. Lacking self-confidence and perhaps seeing the world as a harsh, loveless place, you may feel bitter and cynical, preferring isolation from relationship intimacy. Family ties bind you. This could suggest that you are older than most when you leave home to become independent; or you could have the onerous duty of caring for an elderly parent. Your family life may turn into an imprisoning environment in some way, perhaps through children, economic hardship, or social isolation. You maintain tensions and frustrations by refusing to release behaviour patterns formed during childhood and within your parental relationship. It is your choice, if you wish, to continue limiting your life, but it is not inevitable; limitations are only imaginary parameters which we draw around ourselves as a barrier; they can be erased or expanded. Your creativity is blocked by emotional repression. If you dissolve the barrier and redirect the energies toward positive and constructive channels, then much could be achieved. Finding additional interests and stimulation would be beneficial, showing that the world has much o offer if you open to its riches. Becoming involved with children could reveal new ways to see things; their enthusiasms and sense of wonder could be transmitted to you.

(1861, 0, 'us', 'moon-square-uranus', 7, 'The square''s characteristics are quite similar to the opposition, indicating a clash of disparate energies and personality signals. Relationships are likely to be a battleground; and your domestic life will remain unsettled whenever you struggle with unresolved inner conflicts. While you are mentally alert and quite clever, one challenge could be how you apply your talents. Finding a satisfactory outlet could also benefit your inner balance; failure to do so, through lack of discipline and application, will only exacerbate personality conflicts. You are capable of releasing restrictions from the past; but an idea path for you would be founded on well-established ways (the lunar influence), which also allow enough freedom to explore new horizons (to satisfy Uranus). The problem is how to achieve this balance. Your usual experience involves relinquishing the past, so that you feel free to experience the new. How to do this without unnecessary disruption or pain - for example, by finishing relationships - is the challenge. If you allow the Uranian impulse to dominate, it may sweep away most of your life foundations. While this can create a temporary excitement at glimpsed potentials and a promise of unrestrained liberty, there will inevitably come the time when a consolidation phase to re-anchor roots is necessary. Unlimited freedom is hard to handle without losing stability. Within relationships, several vital lessons may need to be learned. These are co-operation, commitment, responsibility, compromise, and shared decision-making. You have no innate right to be always dominant, authoritative, or right, expecting a partner to acquiesce to your will or bow to your need for freedom when you do not allow the partner the same rights. Changing your behavior patterns to be more positive and creative will work wonders; and intimacy will become more fulfilling for all concerned. Don''t reject your life-style as unsatisfying, or be tempted to ''throw it away'' in search of new excitement\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 03:52:50'),
(1862, 0, 'us', 'moon-square-venus', 7, 'This indicates probably inner stress and tensions related to your social and intimate relationships; your emotions will be the battleground. These emotions will feel extremely powerful; and your fear of losing control over them may result in repressive behavior which tends to avoid relationships that awaken deeper emotional responses. Yet at the same time, you need this emotional involvement and those intense feelings. With your emotions and feelings being polarized, you often prefer to retreat from commitment, rejecting the personal obligations that may be required from relationship. These behavior patterns can be seen in a starker light at times when commitment is required in relationships. Because you refuse to acknowledge the depth of your feelings, deep-rooted fears begin to rise. These can include fear of losing freedom, fear of another''s power over your emotions, and fear of experiencing love''s transformative fires. Once someone begins to impose his or her needs, demands, and will on you, his / her expectations of your predictable behaviour often awakens a rebellious attitude within you. Your insecurity and fears result in contrary behavior that can create relationship conflict just when real progress could be made. Your reactionary drive for independence and your tendency to reject signs of possessive behaviour or demands for your exclusive loyalty may shatter any potentially restrictive relationship. While there may be valid grounds for rejecting such tendencies, your reaction mainly reflects inner fears and unresolved personal issues, and tends to be negative, resulting in heartbreak and disillusionment for yourself and others, and enforcing an increasingly bitter and cynical view of the nature of intimate affairs. Other behaviour patterns associated with this square include self-indulgence and sensuality. You may become involved with indiscriminate affairs and unsuitable partners as a consequence of lacking self-understanding, coupled with a deep need for relationships. Often, attempts at breaking free of threatening restrictions only propel you into other, equally unsatisfying relationships. If you adopt a more passive response to your relationship stresses - instead of taking the active and dominating role - you may experience others taking advantage of your initial trust, manipulating your emotions and needs, and using you as a support and foil for their own emotional tensions and confusions. Sometimes emotions blind you to the real feelings of a partner, until a situation occurs in which, to your surprise, you realize that their feelings are not as powerful as yours. This tendency toward illusions also spills over into your social relationships, where you often misinterpret the honesty and sincerity of others. You can lack understanding of their motivations, so that judgments are seriously affected. Yet this also springs from your lack of self-knowledge; getting to know yourself better will help you to understand others too, and this will enable you to avoid unsuitable relationships. By analyzing the types of people that attract you and the resulting types of relationship, you can expose your hidden needs and behavior patterns, and become aware of those unconscious traits which shape your choices. At some stages in your life, you may need to withdraw a little to gain these perspectives, especially when you are trapped in a repetitive whirl of failed relationships. Your needs are still urgent and pressing; but transforming attitudes through self-understanding may be crucially necessary. Certain patterns active in you are probably derived from childhood experiences and conditioning. The relationship with your parents may have been unsatisfactory, especially in shaping emotional responses, which is why you now have ambivalent and contradictory feelings of need and denial when commitment is expected. There may even be feelings of guilt and non-acceptance of your emotions. A withdrawal from relationship commitment could stem from a similar withdrawal of a parent from you during childhood. You may now unconsciously seek to punish a parent by rejecting others who try to get close to you. Choice of partner is extremely important, and the key to relationship success; but the art of choosing a suitable partner depends on self-knowledge, so that both are complementary and in essential harmony with each other. Your early choices are likely to be unwise; and any early partnership will probably run into troubled waters due to your inner confusions and unresolved issues. New perspectives on yourself and your needs may be achieved through a transformative period of relative isolation from relationships, allowing a pause to dissolve patterns through greater understanding; this can enable insight, emotional maturity, and greater independence. Personal therapy or relationship counseling could be important to progress in future partnerships.

This can manifest itself in a variety of ways, form improving someone''s living conditions, through more aesthetic cultural appreciations, to enjoying a well-made film or admiring an evocative painting of harmony and beauty. The trine indicates the potential for a successful resolution of these two planetary energies, so that inner imaginative and sensitive life is integrated with a suitable form of outer expression. As there is a tendency towards environmental hypersensitivity, you need to discover a way of response that allows you to use this perception in creative ways, through revealing to others this more subtle and perhaps hidden invisible dimension of life, so that they too can appreciate and contact the vitalizing, uplifting and inspirational quality of the inner realms.

No matter what position you take you are positive in your opinions and very insistent about voicing them. You are argumentative, and enjoy locking into debate with anyone who challenges you.

The conjunction indicates a channel between the conscious mind and the unconscious mind, and both the energy and information flowing through this conduit need to be carefully integrated if a variety of imbalances and distortions is not to be created. The faculty of imagination will be highly stimulated and developed, and this will certainly require appropriate channels to be focused on so that other problems of perception are not created. The issue of mental realities is one which can make you unsettled, especially as you can tend to make mistakes in judgment based on misinterpreting facts and suggestive information. You have a mental process that can attempt to re-create experiences into more acceptable forms for personal absorption, a style of selective manipulation which excludes aspects of reality that you refuse to acknowledge. If this process becomes a regular pattern of mental behaviour, then you are liable to create a distinctly personal reality that is a fusion of the real and unreal which can pose additional challenges when it comes to disentangling them. This is often amplified by a tendency to be mentally escapist, avoiding the possibility of any painful experiences and situations by refusing to become involved in things. Relationships are likely to be characterized by over-idealism of lovers, either through having the mental illusion of a perfect lover that is unlikely to exist, and comparing everyone to this perfect lover and so ensuring that they fail to match up, or by wrapping lovers in over-glamorized ideals, elevating them to a mental pedestal and so ensuring that at some time they will inevitably topple off. Your mental images will be shattered, yet this does not deny the real experiences of disappointment and disillusionment that you will suffer... and continue to suffer unless you become more realistic in your evaluations within intimate relationships. Part of this process can arise from the sense of personal inadequacy that you feel and which you try to alleviate by imitation of others you respect or sometimes through attempts to bask in the glow of reflected glamour by associating with publicly famous people, which allows inner fantasies to develop. You are likely to have some creative and artistic talent, and your cultural appreciation will be developed. Your ideal type of employment will offer channels for such forms of personal expression, and it may be that you do develop towards writing, arts, photography or film as you have a gift for visual imagination which also has some inner content. Your approach will be intellectual and mentally resonant, rather than more emotionally evocative as with the Moon contacts. Training may be necessary to help draw out these talents, and your main talent may be related to giving an intellectual substance and context to artistic creations, as a critic does, although there you may need to be careful regarding a degree of intolerance in your attitudes.

Whether these are social facades or intellectual theories or philosophies, your innate curiosity will enable you to look beneath the surface. As you tend to see your mind as a resource which you can utilize, you often collect many fragments of information on your searches, which you attempt to collate together into a workable source. You feel ''at home'' in your mind, enjoying applying it to a multitude of challenges and problems, confident in your ability to resolve them or make some kind of sense out of them. Following your natural investigative ability, you have an inner process occurring whereby you attempt to extract meaning from your studies and experience, hidden meanings that are mostly relevant only to yourself, although some may be of value to a wider audience too.

As usual with the Pluto energy, there will be an unknowable depth and dimension to your mind, with a tendency towards powerfully expressed extremism and assertiveness as your proceed to manifest your objectives. Your ability to concentrate your willpower and sustain it for as long as necessary will aid you in achieving your dreams. Your beliefs and opinions will tend to be fixed; and you will be difficult to shake from any position that you have decided to take, preferring a vigorous expression of your standpoint against any opponents. As you hate to be seen to have a weaker or fallacious argument, you tend to be well-prepared and confident upon any theme that you may be challenged upon; otherwise you have already prepared some way to evade a confrontation if you feel that you could be defeated. There may be a tendency to hold a grudge against any who have opposed you, or who stand in your way; and you will remember them, waiting for a suitable time to settle the scores. Unnecessary social problems and suffering for people will draw out a sense of aggrieved anger in you, as will social and political hypocrisy. You will tend to respond to these feelings by becoming more involved in reorientating your energies into channels which directly oppose those who appear to be creating or amplifying such problems. You feel that you can contribute towards changing things for the better; and this can lead you towards involvement with radical politics. The nature of your political views will depend on your personal analysis of causes; but in extreme cases may tend towards anarchism. Any tactics of subversion will appeal to the Pluto energy, as will the emphasis upon change and transformation. If the social emphasis of Pluto dominates, then much of your life will be directed by the theme of transformation, social and political. You will tend to be demanding in your personal relationships, expecting a high quality and strength from any partner. But even though you may attempt to force him or her to submit to you psychologically, it will be much better for you if you fail, for a good relationship needs equality and mutual respect. You often tend to use your persuasive power to influence others to agree with you; but you have to learn more tolerance and a broader understanding of the freedom and rights of others to hold their own views. Ideally your long-term partner should be similar to you in outlook, motivation and interests, because you may tend to turn the relationship into a form of intellectual power struggle, which would probably turn it sour before long if you did not have these in common. The obsessive tone of Pluto may cause some difficulties, both in your mental preoccupations, and in your relationship, especially if you are unaware of this aspect to yourself, which can easily turn you towards being excessively self-centered if unmoderated. The positive side of a relationship is that it can break down such tendencies, and open up the awareness of ''the other''; certainly you should learn to appreciate any relationship as bringing a more expansive quality into your life. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 03:56:29'),

You are likely to have an alert, clever mind which finds great enrichment in pursuing any aspect of human life and knowledge that you are curious about. You are probably articulate and literate too. You have a natural questioning and searching attitude, always looking to increase your personal storehouse of knowledge, and attempting to derive a sense of connectedness synthesizing that information into more holistic patterns. Your immediate response to the world is one of mental exploration, rather than emotional flowing reaction. The world is perceived as an inextinguishable source of fascination, overflowing with a myriad of stimulating facts, theories and beliefs. New horizons beckon, and there seems to be scope to investigate the unusual and the different ways of living on this multi-hued planet. With so much to delve into, so many different paths that you can walk, the problem is that of choice. Where do you start? There is the fear that by choosing Route 1, you could then miss that fascinating experience down Route 66. This could be one of your weaknesses - that you lack the discipline of perseverance, and that your mind may like to flit from one intriguing subject to another that suddenly attracts your attention. Inner continuity may need to be developed, both to improve your ability to concentrate, and to make the best use of your talent for acquiring knowledge in daily life. Or is it just stored on that mental level, unconnected to real living? You have little patience with ignorance, your own or that of anyone else. You have a compulsion to find out, and will feel restless until you have made some progress. Your mind will store those themes as ''little fascinations'', subjects that have picked your curiosity; and eventually you will have to take steps to satisfy it. You can be a little intolerant with others who have less exploratory minds, and with those who are deceitful in their interpersonal relationships. Certainly you will be best suited to a partner who can complement your searches, and who can stimulate your mind, because for you, that is the essential level of contact. Friendships will develop with others who have affinity interests; and over time you are likely to develop a wide variety of acquaintances as your interests and areas of exploration expand. Unfortunately though, you may find that you also drop older contacts due to your fascination with treading new paths, and thus losing interest in old spheres of enquiry. You have a preference for looking towards the future, optimistic about new discoveries, even if you are studying past history. You may need to balance an emphasis towards preferring fact, and a more scientific rational approach, with the more intuitive interpretative approaches to life, between the objective and the subjective styles of analysis.

(1893, 0, 'us', 'mercury-opposition-neptune', 7, 'Similar to the square aspect, there are indications of an inability to distinguish clearly between the real and the unreal, and of a blockage of the creative and imaginative faculty. The key to resolving these issues appears to lie in your relationships with others, and especially in those projections from your own psyche that you are overlaying onto the world and thus distorting your own perception and insight. It is often your own sensitivity and impressionability to environmental influences that causes inner insecurity and fears of over-stretching yourself. There may be an unconscious telepathic ability which transmits to you others'' thoughts and motivations, and this can lead to confusion in your relationships, such as at times when they may be saying one thing and you are ''receiving'' an entirely contradictory set of impressions on a more subtle level, which you register as a feeling of unease, disquiet and a lack of trust in them. In that context, you find it hard to believe the evidence of your own senses, and this has a direct impact on how you communicate to others. When reality becomes confused and distorted, some respond by imagining conspiracies and enter a paranoid state, and this is a reaction to such intangible senses being operated and distorted by an unintegrated Neptunian imagination. You are often socially ''touchy'', strongly reacting against real or imagined social slights, and this acts as a weak spot in your personality, especially as you lack a strengthening inner confidence. Competition is not your style, although that does not make you immune to the influences of other competitive spirits in your environment, such as those at work who can easily ride roughshod over you in their scramble to reach the top. Sometimes you act as a victim, drawing out such tendencies from others, and then begin to bemoan your fate as they succeed and leave you only with disappointments. Linking your rising star to working closely in employment dog fights may not be advisable. Your own gifts may flower more effectively once you have withdrawn from the employment rat race. Perhaps exploiting latent creative talents may be the key, or entering some form of employment where co-operation is the underlying dynamic may offer you more satisfaction; but as human nature intrudes even there, the only answer may be a detached and sensible self-employment. Cleansing yourself of deceptive influences is essential, not just those outer influences affecting you, but also that pattern of creating them in your own perception and evaluation. Unrealistic daydreams which are unachievable or never manifested are symptomatic of deception. For example, you create imaginatively high aspirations which because of their ''perfect nature'' soar beyond everyone''s grasp, yet glitter in their pristine purity. Ultimately there is no real value in self-deception. It is a waste of valuable time and never leads to satisfaction. Perhaps it helps to avoid facing an empty, aching inner void, but that can more profitably be filled by something real, achievable and personally meaningful. Effort is needed. Anyone can dream, millions do, but trying to achieve those dreams at least offers a direction to focus along. False naivety needs to be dropped, as do the fictitious aspects of your life and your approach to self-evaluation. A more straightforward type of communication, inner and outer, will reap benefits and break the stranglehold of illusory deceptions, leading to a greater understanding of your own and others'' natures, so that in your own life you move from illusion to reality and increase the quantity of light in the world. Personal ''redemption'' is always positive within a larger social context. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 03:58:37'),

Due to the inner agitation and anxiety, your perception of the world and your feelings response to events will be strongly colored by its activity. This is not necessarily to imply that your interpretation is wrong, but that your experience of it will affect you more deeply and influentially than it would most other people, who could possibly give it more sense of proportion than you can. Basically, the tone of your insight will be pessimistic and essentially depressive, and you will see the world as a place where disorder, pain and problems are rapidly multiplying. Social problems feel personal and real to you, even if your own circumstances do not bring you into personal contact with them. Your sensitivity (or inner receptivity) leads you to see a world in crisis, makes you feel responsible for its problems, and offers little way out for you unless you become involved in efforts to improve matters. It is a ''social conscience writ large and painfully''. The frustrating thing for you is that however effective you are, so much work still needs to be done in the world. You have to accept the fact that you cannot change anything, and that your role is to make your own contribution but not everyone else''s. This sense of impatience in life creates a corresponding vibration in you that expresses itself as a brusque harshness in relating to others. The contradiction is that whilst you intend to improve life and bring harmony into people''s relationships, you often create the opposite reaction to your purpose. An interrogatory style in talking to others will create distance; and under pressure of your ''mission'' you often lose sight of co-operative relationship with others. You need to learn more compromise and moderation, paying equal attention to the needs and feelings of co-workers or partners. You have high ideals, yet are often lacking in self-confidence over your ability to express them or live up to them; generally, no one can live up to high ideals, so relax a little, create a little space between you and this inner obsession, and devote more time to internalizing this energy to transform yourself. It is a difficult tension to live with, this feeling of interrelatedness with the world, a sense of responsibility and direction that you are ''summoned'' to give aid to lighten the burden.

(1896, 0, 'us', 'mercury-opposition-uranus', 7, 'With this opposition, you are likely to experience conflicts in your social relationships. The problem area will be in how you express yourself in communicating with others, and those inner attitudes which condition that style of communication. Whilst you will have considerable mental vitality, the difficulty will be in directing this into productive channels. The tendency will be towards an erratic inner activity; the nature of your beliefs, ideals and thought-patterns will be changeable; and the attractions of new stimulation will often tempt you away from completing existing projects. The challenge of the new redirects your energy and interests; and so your commitments and responsibilities may feel like restrictive liabilities. Despite this erratic pattern of mind, you tend to insist that whatever you say and think is valid, even though only a short time ago you were vehemently declaring an entirely opposite attitude, idea or belief. Obviously, this can lead to interpersonal conflict, as most people prefer dealing with relatively stable and consistent individuals, as it helps to develop trust and continuity. Yet if others challenge you by repeating past statements that you have made and are now contradicting, you tend to take offence, often attempting to deny that you ever did say that. Essentially, your reaction is often to deny all prior expressions of your self, refusing to take any responsibility for them. Having experienced this aspect of your nature, many people will begin to draw away from maintaining a relationship with you, because you seem unreliable and difficult to believe. This in a peculiar way reinforces a tendency in you to see yourself as ''unique and misunderstood, which you often use to justify a rejection of social compromise; and you never admit in any circumstances that you are wrong. You appear to project the belief that you ''know it all'', and probably succeed more in deluding yourself that you do than in persuading others of your expert knowledge. Underlying these more negative styles of expression is a personality which experiences inner confusion and insecurity, yet attempts to hide this by a superficial image of intellectual superiority. Emotionally, there is likely to be immaturity and lack of ease with that level of your nature, and you are unlikely to touch others easily with the warmth of your personality. This lack of sensitivity and responsiveness to the more intangible ''feeling'' aspect of human contact often leads to a tactless and blunt expression, where your ignorance of diplomacy can have negative consequences. How can you resolve or moderate these challenges within your relationships? The first important step is to acknowledge their presence, to admit that you often are this way. The fact that you may deny them to yourself does not mean that others do not see them clearly. Often, others do see such problem areas, whilst the individual is apparently blind to their existence. They are personal delusions. Being willing to work with people, learning to compromise, and participating as an intellectual equal, will help to moderate these oppositional tendencies. It is a new sense of personal identity that you should attempt to develop, one founded upon the real you, and not the socially projected assertive one that others may react against. It will involve an acceptance of your inner vulnerability, dissolving that peculiar egotistical construction, and ceasing your attempts to impress people. By stopping that process, you may begin to find your centre, resolve certain conflicts, and redirect the flow of the aspect energy towards personal renewal.

There can be a preference for mental avoidance and for escaping from directly confronting aspects of life that you find unpleasant, such as personal truths and social problems. Sometimes your logic is very circuitous, too personal or abstracted for easy communication to either yourself or others, and, as it often absorbs an imaginative influence, it can veil the truth from sight. You can shy away from accepting responsibilities, domestic, family and marriage ones especially, as you can feel uneasy with your emotions, and this results in you often becoming unreliable with others. There may have been factors in your earlier life that have helped bring this about - childhood or parental relationships which have exacerbated this innate tendency of escapism - but one result has been distorted images on the mental level of your own identity and mind activity, as well as a diminution of personal confidence. There are steps that you can take to improve matters. The first involves the willingness to face the actual realities of yourself and the world, so that a clarified perspective can be established. A greater integration of Neptunian sensitivity is essential, but in a way that absorbs it into a renewed life rather than as another excuse for escapist tendencies. Following that development, additional progress can be made in reorganizing your mind to work down more productive channels of expression.

You felt you were being punished because you were expected to maintain your grades. It''s not that you are incapable, but rather indolent and mentally lazy.

You have enough of a sense of freedom to know that life does not have to be the way your parents, teachers, employers, politicians and priests tell you. So you become an outsider.

The essence of your creative spirit will be evocative imagery, often including meaningful depths and at times an inspirational quality. The way in which you succeed in expressing this could be through art, music, vivid literary creations, poetry, film or photography. Your creativity should possess substance and context, rather than any superficiality. Communication to others is important to you. You are potentially very effective in transmitting your ideas and intentions, and skilled in the forms in which you clothe your messages. There can be a taste for dramatic presentations, but this is also effective as it ensures that anything you create is noticed by others, and that by grasping their attention you create a situation where some response is evoked. You have a talent for influencing people''s minds by subtle manipulation and perhaps through clever handling of communication media, as you have a natural understanding of the essential motivation patterns of others. This can be amplified by using the Neptunian vibration to emphasize an intuitive or telepathic ability, which sometimes also manifests itself in the guise of prophecy. It may be best not to overdevelop any such tendencies, or to openly publicize them, but to use them quietly and with little fuss in daily life, especially if through your empathic awareness you are able to support and aid others. There is the potential to have extremely powerful visualization abilities, that inner picture-making faculty where within the mind you can create images in detail and color, ''seeing them in the mind''s eye''.

Its natural affinity tends to be towards higher science or metaphysics, where the interface between mind and reality is explored and understood in terms of consciousness and energy. It relates more to a trained intellect working in spheres of abstract contemplation, or the connection between the intuitive flash of direct ''knowing'' and the grounding through intellectual earthing in a pragmatic application.

You find it hard to motivate yourself in such a situation. In personal relationships, you can be a little authoritarian, especially as you believe that you have a clear sense of ''right and wrong'' and can become fixed in your attitudes. You are able to penetrate through social appearances into people, to sense their true attitudes and motives. this guides you in life, both to be wary of some, and to work with others whose genuine potential you are able to stimulate. This can lead to an involvement with co-ordinating groups where your energy serves both to stimulate new thinking and to open it out to new insights entering the group, or new ways of applying current ideas in practical application. You can be a little too mentally self-absorbed, and lack the sense of social concern and responsibility that the Pluto energy amplifies in most people who are responding to its lighter side. Ideally, your personal partners should be basically similar in mind and attitude to yourself.

(1933, 0, 'us', 'venus-conjunct-neptune', 7, 'This conjunction of Neptune and Venus indicates that there is likely to be a high degree of idealization in the spheres of romantic relationships, images of ''perfect lovers and partners'' emanating from an overshadowing by either the anima (if male) or the animus (if female) inner patterns arising from the unconscious mind. When evoked by powerful emotions of love, lust, passion and attraction to another person, these images of perfection are projected onto the loved one, forming a glamour which is quite bewitching - until frail human nature eventually reasserts its presence and the image collapses through a phase of disillusionment, when the lovers fail to conform to that pattern of perfection which has been superimposed upon them. Essentially, you''ll have a simple, trusting attitude, which can become unwisely gullible at times, resulting in consequences of deception and exploitations. This emotional sensitivity makes you extremely vulnerable, and is often the source of difficulties in your personal and intimate relationships. You hate confrontation, tending to be more passive and giving, and will shy away from any emotional aggression and insensitivity shown by anyone. Part of your ideal relationship includes refined culture, art, music and literature as common interests or personal talents, and where the concepts and environments of harmony and beauty predominate in a peaceful and tranquil lifestyle. You have an appreciation of the more subtle delights of life, with a sensitive and perceptive aesthetic sense, and your standards of partner and lifestyle will be quite high and demanding. There will be an active and vivid imagination at play, looking to see or create harmony and beauty, perhaps reflecting in an artistic manner contemporary fashions in art, music, literature, fashion and culture. Your heart will be soft and tender, and often that sensitivity will be unsuitable for many of the more jarring and discordant environments of the modern world; you will hate having to rush around jostling in large groups of people. You prefer those sophisticated cultural scenes, with perhaps a small grouping of successful and intelligent people. Being delicate in the modern world which is swept by powerful collective changes can be a disturbing sensitivity. This is why you often wear those rose-colored glasses, so that the stark reality and grim harshness of certain aspects is not clearly perceived or is kept at a distance. You can''t avoid the wholeness of the world, and such abrasive experiences often stimulate disturbances in your life, as if trying to force you to look at them without distortion. This tendency continues into evaluating others in a realistic manner, especially when projections are evoked; often you are disappointed when their true natures are revealed. You can be too impressionable at times, especially through that emotional empathy with others, and can revert back into being an impractical, idealistic and ineffectual dreamer if clarity and focus are lacking. You may need to learn to stand on your own feet, and be less reliant on others. Some can succeed in expressing degrees of universal love, healing through their spiritual understanding and acceptance of others; but in treading this path, there is also the crucifixion of the heart, and a willingness to share in the world''s suffering. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 04:06:07'),

What you are searching for is ''the ultimate physical / emotional affair'', a consuming passionate involvement with your ideal partner; and this desire will play a prominent role in your choices of partner for relationship. Unfortunately, what you are chasing is more of an illusion rather than a reality, a dream figure projected from your own psyche that you look to find in the objective world the anima and animus images of Jungian psychology. As real life has a habit of shattering illusions, you will often be frustrated in your relationships, which could lead you to experiment with a variety of partners, none of whom seems to fit your inner picture of ''perfection''. Emotionally, you can be difficult to satisfy, as you tend to believe that there is always a greater intensity and experience that has so far eluded you, but which would be within your reach if only you could find the right partner. Inevitably, your emotional life will be full of highs and lows; and the likelihood is that you will either break up promising relationships or allow them to fall apart by withdrawing your commitment, because you are already casting your net for a more suitable mate. It can be difficult for someone who is emotionally attached to you, as you tend to ''blow hot and cold'', fire, passion and intensity, and ice, distance and disinterest, as your partner displays his or her more frail human face. Only a ''god or a goddess'' will do for you! The point is that you are externalizing your inner ideal partner; and what is required is that you realize that you have to evoke these qualities from within your own nature, to become more complete and self-sufficient in yourself, rather than look for another to bear the strain of expressing them, and upon whom you lean. You have to reabsorb your own fantasy projection, stop expecting another to live up to your ideal, and learn how to embody it yourself. It is a step in moving towards the inner androgynous state of being, where the physical male integrates his anima, allowing ''traditional feminine qualities'' of sensitivity, intuitiveness, nurturing and caring to enrich his life, and the physical woman integrates her animus, releasing qualities of action, intellect and assertiveness to enrich her life; an inner balance. Until you begin to make progress in this inner psychological necessity, then it is likely that you will continue to find an underlying dissatisfaction in your relationships, a feeling that there must be more somewhere. You need to change in order to create an opportunity for your relationships to stand a chance of working; you need to accept the real nature of people, their weaknesses and strengths, and learn to love real flesh and blood people. Potentially, your capacity for the intensity of love can stimulate considerable transformation in yourself and partners, acting as a healing and development catalyst; the process of rebirth in your life will come via your emotions, but be prepared to suffer the ''death of the heart'' first. Your vitality and energy can give you an artistic temperament and ability, coupled with a style of dramatic self-expression; and people will rarely respond to you in a lukewarm manner, finding themselves either strongly attracted to the consuming flame or repulsed as the intensity is too much for them. Transformation, perhaps through the reorientation of your excess vital emotional energy towards a spiritual or social cause, could help regeneration, offering equal intensity but from a stabilized inner balance. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 04:06:31'),

This sometimes stems from a lack of trust in the opposite sex. Often this aspect signifies a person whose childhood was unhappy. This may have been a result of difficulties with the opposite-sex parent, a strife-filled or broken home, or being ridiculed or ignored by the opposite sex in the teenage years. Occasionally it results from a too-early sexual experience that came before the person was mature enough to understand and handle it. Anyway, there''s often a carry-over of these childhood experiences and the emotions stemming from them into the adult years. Often therapy can banish these ''ghost emotions'' and lead to a more satisfactory love life. Sometimes sexual / romantic energies are sublimated into artistic activities. For those who are inclined to be excessively intense, involvement in art or music can bring strong emotions down to a manageable level. If you have Venus opposing Mars by sign but not by aspect, the foregoing may apply to you. However, less energy would be expended in passionate hating; you''d be more inclined to just break up and go on. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 04:08:15'),

How this tends to manifest in your life is likely to be through an underlying suspicion and distrust of others, perhaps based on actual experiences where you have been a victim of deception and deceit, or where you feel that others have badly let you down and reneged on actual or implicit promises. As ''energy follows thought'', because you are projecting a pattern of suspicion and lack of trust into the world, it is likely that you are receiving back the consequences of your own inner pattern. This is often formed by unresolved, unintegrated and unconscious factors associated with the influence of Neptune operating through a heightened emotional sensitivity and vulnerability. As the strength of imagination in you is potentially very potent, if it is misused or unrecognized then unconscious inner needs and desires create compulsive motivations formed around private fantasies and perceptual distortions of reality. These inner pressures affect the stability and content of your emotional level, so that one result can be moods and uncertainty regarding the consistency of your feelings. Obviously this will affect your intimate relationships, and can demonstrate its presence in a variety of forms of deception, within yourself and within the love affair. The ''enemy'' that you often project ''out there'' is hidden within yourself. Those Neptunian patterns of victim, sacrifice and martyr may emerge, either as experienced by you, or as expressed through you onto others, where you exploit any powers of sexual seduction that you possess for self-gratification. Sensual preoccupation may appeal to you, yet this could hold the seeds of your own destruction within it, as there is likely to be an addictive tendency operating which is associated with alcohol, drugs and sex. Surrendering to this pattern would be most unwise, and a reflection of an unintegrated Neptune. Greater clarity and honesty in relationships is probably needed; or the consequences of this will emerge through deceit, by your own secret love affairs or those of a partner. Certainly trust will be a casualty, and if not perceived correctly will only serve to add more fuel to the fires of your own suspicious outer projections. Marriage may become an uneasy battleground and a focus for inner pressures and stress.

It is important to remember that this influence to confront the darker side of the psyche is inherently positive and creatively beneficial if it is used to reorientate the inner life, and that this is he hidden purpose of the Pluto impulses. It is likely that you will experience a repetitive pattern of sexual love and emotional affairs which either do not seem to satisfy and fulfill you, or collapse into failure, acrimony and suffering. This can lead to a jaded, cynical attitude founded upon a frustrated, demoralized emotionally battered perception of love. Your emotional intensity and passion is likely to cause difficulties for you, as it often seems to run away out of your control, and can take you into situations and encounters which from a clearer perspective you would consider to be undesirable. Certainly you are looking for something; but your sexual and emotional desires can be too strong, creating distortions of inner energy and leading to compulsive behavior on your part - followed by an attempt at justification in the vein of ''I couldn''t help myself...''. Either you will feel driven to experiment in various relationships on a continuous basis, or, as a reaction, you may attempt to avoid entering any emotional affair as you are afraid of experiencing the old established pattern again. Problems can arise in your intimate relationships due to your tendency to introduce the element of domination. You tend to demand your own way or assume a dominating role, sometimes played out in potentially damaging sexual and emotional contexts, sometimes obvious, sometimes more subtle. Even if you assume a submissive role, it is only as a hidden way to manipulate and achieve your intentions through a subtle route; it is not your natural approach. Usually, you want your partners to change to suit you, and you can put intense pressure upon them, especially sexually and emotionally. You will need to learn the necessity for mutual compromise in relationships, to understand your inner underlying desires and impulses which are conditioning and controlling you from the depths of your unconscious. It may be appropriate to study humanistic psychology, or take part in a course or therapy designed to bring about safe release of hidden impulses into the light of conscious awareness. Such impulses, and unconscious inner fantasy lives, are present to some degree in everyone; but with this aspect they will stimulate problems for you, which are resolvable if you are willing to confront them in an act of personal reintegration and transformation. This will also serve to balance out your erratic flow of emotional desires, which often seems to confuse you and your partner, as you appear to ''blow very hot and very cold'' in your responses to them; this is when your inner impulses arise and fall in some hidden rhythmic cycle, leading to uncontrollable emotional and sexual needs and intensity, or to a lack of response and to coldness. Always, the choice is yours; potentially you can defuse many of the difficulties that usually face you in relationships, or you can continue hoping that they will lift of their own accord. Pluto is influencing you to take the positive approach, by facing you with the results of being passive to the inner forces and by remaining unconscious of their hidden promptings. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 04:08:45'),

You will often feel disturbed by emotional insecurity and an instability in the consistency of your feelings towards others. In intimate relationships, this will be displayed in swings between red-hot passions and ice-cold disinterest. This puzzles you, and can obviously confuse a partner, especially when the need for a deeper commitment arises. You wouldn''t be sure what to do; and your lover would doubt your real feelings. Your desires can feel extremely powerful, demanding satisfaction; and the intensity of this energy can lead you to explore unconventional ways of life. A certain impulsiveness and reckless spirit can take you into experiences that could be dangerous; and your choices for relationships may often create future problems for you. Your unconventional style and basically friendly nature will attract friends; but your own sense of attachment and commitment to them may be erratic. You will be too much drawn by the glamour of following your own unique light to maintain friendships; and some will fall by the wayside as you move ever onwards. Most of your tendency to oppose will be directed towards authority and those who embody a traditional social structure. As a natural rebel, you will question the foundations of your society, challenge their effectiveness, and probably support the causes of those who are oppressed or disadvantaged by the dominant political attitudes. You have several characteristics which can be used positively, such as a strong will and determination, and an acceptance of intellectual responsibility (sometimes subverted by emotional instability). The use of these will depend upon your ability to be clear about your objectives, and to maintain enough emotional commitment to fuel your efforts to achieve them. There is likely to be a need to learn greater compromise and consistency, especially within your intimate relationships, and to evoke the Venus energy to a higher degree.

(1965, 0, 'us', 'venus-square-neptune', 7, 'With the square, there can be difficulties with the inhibition of emotions, creativity and relationships with others. Part of this difficulty arises from an extreme sensitivity of feelings which have never been properly integrated. The square is one of the Neptune aspects that stimulates those emotional-level fogs and mists, creating a consequence of being unable to see clearly and of being liable to make misjudgements; and which fuels tendencies of self-deception and mental distortion. These factors tend to make you vulnerable to deception, prone to suffer from your own reality projections and filters, and from the choices and actions of others who may be similarly psychologically influenced. Intimate relationships can be a source of challenges, especially when you have made some form of emotional commitment, as often your choice of lover or partner results from misjudgement. You are basically idealistic, yet this is likely to attract you towards involvement with minority cults or foreign religions because of their glamours and strange fascinations. In several ways, these are symptomatic of an inner need of transformation, of the need to redeem negative patterns dominating your life. Sexuality as a powerful aspect of the impulse for relationships can be a prime area in which such dilemmas can be expressed. This can be revealed through needs for multiple partners, searching for a perfect thgouh unattainable lover, yet being unprepared and unwilling to actually commit yourself to a real flesh-and-blood person. It may emerget through excessive sexual imagination, where unfulfilled sexual imagery and desires may be intertwined with underlying and repressed emotionally based complexes, or are practised secretly and conspire to build an area of denial in your life. Changes are probably needed in order to integrate the Neptune energy into your life, so that it ceases to display its more negative face of unresolution. Your attitutdes to others through relationships need to be redefined, so that any paranoia is dropped, as well as any tendencies toward exploitation by yourself or against yourself. Standing free and independent is preferable, at ltast as an initial cleansing process. Turning within through meditation or forms of self-therapy is an ideal path to take, so that you begin to release the old patterns, discover a new centre by cleaning out old illusions, and see through new eyes. Meditation is a deconditioning technique, sequentially liberating through practice, and redirecting the energy flow of the mind not inwards instead of outwards, so the energy acts as a penetrating disperser of restrictive psychological patterns.\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-20 04:12:55'),

You are probably too self-centred in relationship, eagerly taking but giving less in return, and yet discovering that you are still not experiencing the peaks of emotional and sexual intensity that you imagine are there; this builds a feeling of frustration over time, which dissipates much of your ability to enjoy and causes you to begin a process of withdrawal form your commitment and responsibility, mentally, emotionally and physically. A conflict that you encounter is that of chasing your desires, or chasing your needs. You may need to spend some time actually deciding what your real needs actually are, as opposed to desires. Crises associated with relationship and emotions are likely, providing you with the possibility of transformation and understanding of the energies of love, emotion and sex within yourself. This can break down your self-preoccupation, making you able to give and compromise more with your partner, to resolve the dangers of negative relationship and to have more conscious control over your strong impulsive drives and desires.

When evoked by powerful emotions of love, lust, passion and attraction to another person, these images of perfection are projected onto the loved one, forming a glamour which is quite bewitching - until frail human nature eventually reasserts its presence and the image collapses through a phase of disillusionment, when the lovers fail to conform to that pattern of perfection which has been superimposed upon them. Essentially, you''ll have a simple, trusting attitude, which can become unwisely gullible at times, resulting in consequences of deception and exploitations. This emotional sensitivity makes you extremely vulnerable, and is often the source of difficulties in your personal and intimate relationships. You hate confrontation, tending to be more passive and giving, and will shy away from any emotional aggression and insensitivity shown by anyone. Part of your ideal relationship includes refined culture, art, music and literature as common interests or personal talents, and where the concepts and environments of harmony and beauty predominate in a peaceful and tranquil lifestyle. You have an appreciation of the more subtle delights of life, with a sensitive and perceptive aesthetic sense, and your standards of partner and lifestyle will be quite high and demanding.

You can''t avoid the wholeness of the world, and such abrasive experiences often stimulate disturbances in your life, as if trying to force you to look at them without distortion. This tendency continues into evaluating others in a realistic manner, especially when projections are evoked; often you are disappointed when their true natures are revealed. You can be too impressionable at times, especially through that emotional empathy with others, and can revert back into being an impractical, idealistic and ineffectual dreamer if clarity and focus are lacking. You may need to learn to stand on your own feet, and be less reliant on others.

What you are searching for is ''the ultimate physical / emotional affair'', a consuming passionate involvement with your ideal partner; and this desire will play a prominent role in your choices of partner for relationship. Unfortunately, what you are chasing is more of an illusion rather than a reality, a dream figure projected from your own psyche that you look to find in the objective world the anima and animus images of Jungian psychology. As real life has a habit of shattering illusions, you will often be frustrated in your relationships, which could lead you to experiment with a variety of partners, none of whom seems to fit your inner picture of ''perfection''. Emotionally, you can be difficult to satisfy, as you tend to believe that there is always a greater intensity and experience that has so far eluded you, but which would be within your reach if only you could find the right partner. Inevitably, your emotional life will be full of highs and lows; and the likelihood is that you will either break up promising relationships or allow them to fall apart by withdrawing your commitment, because you are already casting your net for a more suitable mate. It can be difficult for someone who is emotionally attached to you, as you tend to ''blow hot and cold'', fire, passion and intensity, and ice, distance and disinterest, as your partner displays his or her more frail human face. Only a ''god or a goddess'' will do for you! The point is that you are externalizing your inner ideal partner; and what is required is that you realize that you have to evoke these qualities from within your own nature, to become more complete and self-sufficient in yourself, rather than look for another to bear the strain of expressing them, and upon whom you lean. You have to reabsorb your own fantasy projection, stop expecting another to live up to your ideal, and learn how to embody it yourself. It is a step in moving towards the inner androgynous state of being, where the physical male integrates his anima, allowing ''traditional feminine qualities'' of sensitivity, intuitiveness, nurturing and caring to enrich his life, and the physical woman integrates her animus, releasing qualities of action, intellect and assertiveness to enrich her life; an inner balance. Until you begin to make progress in this inner psychological necessity, then it is likely that you will continue to find an underlying dissatisfaction in your relationships, a feeling that there must be more somewhere. You need to change in order to create an opportunity for your relationships to stand a chance of working; you need to accept the real nature of people, their weaknesses and strengths, and learn to love real flesh and blood people. Potentially, your capacity for the intensity of love can stimulate considerable transformation in yourself and partners, acting as a healing and development catalyst; the process of rebirth in your life will come via your emotions, but be prepared to suffer the ''death of the heart'' first. Your vitality and energy can give you an artistic temperament and ability, coupled with a style of dramatic self-expression; and people will rarely respond to you in a lukewarm manner, finding themselves either strongly attracted to the consuming flame or repulsed as the intensity is too much for them.

(1990, 0, 'us', 'mars-conjunct-neptune', 7, 'This conjunction can pose several difficulties, in choice of actions, where you may struggle to establish what your real aims are; in making that final decision to attempt to achieve them, and in ensuring that sufficient and persistent effort is then made to guarantee success. An unintegrated Neptune can dissolve that focused will, making decisive clarity difficult to maintain. Additionally, you tend to avoid accepting the consequences of your choices, and there can be a refusal to acknowledge responsibility when such actions lead to failure or negative results. Part of this derives from lack of prior consideration and a willingness to sometimes jump into action on impulse alone; yet this is often used as a spur to be decisive. ''I didn''t know it would turn out like that...'' is used as a defensive excuse, and is probably true because possible repercussions were not evaluated. Yet continuing with such an approach is essentially avoiding personal responsibility. You may realize eventually that most actions you take on impulse go awry in some respect, rarely fulfilling your initial intention. This issue related to choice and action is one which needs clarification and resolving. You may find that it is beneficial to pause before acting on impulse, and sensible to slow down and take time to consider the likely results of your decision. This may then show you alternative routes to take, or may even dissuade you from taking action at all. As Mars will influence you to be more dynamically assertive, you need to take into account your effects on other people too, especially any family and those closest to you. This may then modify your more self-centered tendencies and ensure that through insensitivity you do not then create unnecessary pain for anyone. You can be quite attractive to others, as the Mars-Neptune energies combine to create a potentially dynamic glamour, yet this apparent combination of action and sensitivity can often be superficial when the Mars characteristics are dominating the more subtle Neptune ones, which is more often the situation. Neptunian qualities come through disguised as a flexibility of personality, a set of masks and images that you almost automatically assume in your relations with people and in social or work environments. You recognize that these lead to some inner confusion, especially in respect of decision-making; but they are also usable for self-projection. You quite enjoy playing with these masks and feeling that your real intentions are hidden within a secret persona; you do not really like others to know you too well. This leads to the attraction of acting behind images, and there is often a dramatic side to your nature, perhaps through some creative expression or even theater work, where imagination can flourish in an evocative situation and you can be hidden behind the mask, performing a role. Certainly you will develop a favorite image of yourself which is projected out for others to see you through. Some have affinities with medicine and healing abilities; even here, you may hide behind the image of nurse, doctor, consultant or psychic healer. Alternatively, your dreams and desires about yourself could be unrealistic; and whilst you aspire to great status and achievement, your lack of will or application and your impracticality defeat you. Ultimately, your image of self-elevation may only exist within your imagination. Steps can be taken to improve matters though. Feeling able to release your blocked imagination into daily life is important, because whilst initially such a move may be glamorous and ineffective, you can learn to direct it towards deliberate intentions, and so use it as a powerful energy to achieve your aims. Techniques of creative visualization are recommended to take advantage of this process of mental imagination, and can help to re-create your life. Future planning can help you to gain greater control too, so that there is less opportunity for something unconsidered to destroy your intention. And working hard to actually achieve viable skills is another way of helping yourself; if you do not do this, that unintegrated Neptune will serve only to dissolve those dreams instead of helping to fulfill them. In intimate relationships, more awareness will probably be needed. A combination of impulsive Mars and the self-deluding tendency of Neptune may conspire to show you the pain of disappointing illusions in love. Mars can encourage you into sudden passionate affairs, caught within the glamours of a new lover, but when you are directed by purely unconscious motivations the likelihood is that suffering will result, as a prompt to make you more aware the next time.

This is the unpredictable instability of the Uranian vibration, which is interfering with the drive of Mars.

Actions can be taken without due thought or consideration, and this can create future difficulties, through following unwise choices. A lack of sensitivity to others, and a diminution of common sense, can occur; and you may look for ways to release the sudden pressure that can rapidly build up inside you. In extreme cases, this can be expressed through explosions of temper and anger at any provocation, even to the point of physical violence; certainly attempts to release the energy through verbal and emotionally directed violence towards a partner are common. You prefer to retain as much independence as possible; and you are not one to bow to any authority. Basically, you are anti-establishment, a natural rebel, an anarchist. You see your own will and desires as paramount, following a purely personal code of behaviour which is determined by a self-centered perspective on life. You tend to insist on your right to be free to follow your own path and ambitions, and can experience relationship problems through this attitude, and may need to learn the values of co-operation to modify this tendency. Your search for excitement is mainly in terms of physically based action, which can be through competitive sports, or in sexual conquests. You feel a strong need to ''feed'' this urge for physical / material level action, and it is tied in with a need to prove yourself in relation to others, to prove that you are better than them in some chosen way. In some ways, the rebellious spirit can find suitable channels through becoming an opponent of the Establishment, but one who is working from within a socially accepted framework, attempting to change society from within. It may be argued that this is the most effective way, to initiate constructive change through speaking out on behalf of a minority or disadvantaged social group. Irrespective of how you may express this tendency, you will tend to look for results to occur in the physical world as a reflection of your impact. You can have little patience for social rules, preferring to disregard them; but apart from you being penalized if you contravene them, you may have to learn the art of apparent conformity in order to create a foundation that you can work from in your own inimitable, subversive way.

You must be careful not to cut off all sources of support, for it can be lonely to be cast off by your peers. Your best opportunities to gain recognition and express your creative potentials would be in law, government, sports, communications media, acting, teaching, or public relations. Once you learn to temper your combative tendencies with moderation, you can achieve great heights. Even your competitors will admire you for a job well done. Your only problem is your fear of inadequacy in the face of responsibility. Careful planning and application should relieve you of any anxiety in this respect. You''ve got to know you are qualified to meet challenges without feeling threatened by competitors. Your physical desires are as powerful as your ambitions. You are not satisfied unless you can express your sexual appetite when aroused. This can cause problems, unless you are lucky enough to have someone available at all times. This will not be an important matter if Saturn makes a contact to Mars, giving you a built-in factor of self-control. Your mate must match your physical prowess in this respect, or complications will develop that can seriously endanger the relationship. Moderation is advised in everything you do. Indecision will be an irritant until you recognize your self-worth and can take a firm stand without waiting for approval. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 03:43:43'),

On one hand, you may be subject to compulsive desires, wanting to do things without any special reason except willfulness.

Sometimes this happens because you have had such a stormy and turbulent home life as a young child that all your resentment comes out in sudden aggressive energies. To counter this, your parents should provide you with a reasonably stable and supportive home life, where you can feel that you are accepted for yourself.

You will be conscious of these needs, so that you can gratify them in a controlled way instead of being at the mercy of your inner drives. In general, you will succeed by creating a satisfying inner life more than by achieving in ways that the outer world can easily recognize. You may or may not be successful in your career, but that will not be as important to you as inner satisfaction.

As with the square aspect, there is the presence of the unconscious mind being activated by a frustrated Neptune, which lead to distortions in action and expression. Inner motivation is often unclear in respect of its true nature, and often compulsive desires are hidden behind a fa?ade so effectively that even you are often essentially unconscious of why you act in certain ways and way is actually making those decisive choices for you. Self-clarity can be difficult to achieve, especially in the areas of emotional and sexual desire, which can have a compulsive quality to them, and which can dominate your options. Those areas may become highly emphasized in your life, excessively so and out of a healthy proportion and perspective. You probably lack trust and faith in life. Suspicion is a constant companion, and you see others through such a filter, yet this is often mainly composed of your own nature projected out like a shadow over the world. How can you trust yourself when you do not fully comprehend your own motivations and desires for actions? Yet you often mean well, but yare let down by your own tendencies of secrecy and manipulation. Your own attitudes are reflected back at you, so that mutual suspicion is often created, and you lose even more trust in people. Sometimes you tend to withdraw from social activity due to this. A refinement in how you choose to assert yourself may be necessary, as well as a withdrawal of these conditioning negative characteristics. Confronting reality is essential, so that, by acceptance, a more realistic balance in relationships can emerge - one where your desires are less dominant and threatening, and where the emotional dimension is more integrated and explored. This will help to modify and redirect the blocked Neptune energy so that relationships become deeper, more satisfying and a bridge to renew your experience of social relating. Evaluating your ambitions in life can be more productive once the projections are being withdrawn, and using intellect and common sense can be more effective in realizing them than following a path of glamour and compulsive desires which, whilst perhaps temporarily exciting, leads to a dissipation of your self and your objectives. Avoidance of unnecessary stimulants is also wise, as these will not help; and a more perceptive insight into the nature of glamour and illusion will also be highly beneficial. This is especially so if you have become involved in the occult or spiritual realms of life, where there are always many candidates to take advantage of those who are more gullible and susceptible to the power of ''secret knowledge''. Those how have the desire to be ''special'' are often abused physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. The nature and quality of your relationships can be transformed, provided that you deal with those problematic areas of your inner nature, trust, emotions, sexuality and illusions. Perceiving how you can negatively condition your experience is the key to realizing how you can positively transform it too. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 03:43:58'),

You probably require a greater understanding of the nature of personal power, the right application of it to benefit the group rather than to satisfy purely personal aims and desires, especially as you may have the tendency to take advantage of a group''s power and influence to further your own ambitions. Your nature will express a forceful will, which can be experienced by others as aggressiveness, making them avoid too close a contact with you; in fact, you often appear to be quite unaware of your effect on people; and a greater sensitivity to the rights and reality of others is a quality that you could do well to help develop. This would help minimize any negative effect you may have on others, especially those in close relationship to you, whom you often attempt to dominate. Control in an intimate context is attractive to you; and you are likely to have an intense and powerful sexual nature, which at times can lead towards an affinity with forms of potentially violent passion and sexual undertones. You tend to link sex with power as an exaltation of personal force; and this can stimulate certain problems, although some potential partners can find the sheer physicality extremely exciting and provocative. This, plus the psychological manipulation that you attempt, can lead to stormy relations; and you are probably wiser to moderate and discipline your release of energy through a controlled awareness of its impact on others. You may observe that your flow of sexual energy can be erratic and irregular, where your passions are either ''hot'' or very ''cold'', and you are basically unable to regulate them according to demand or switch them on. In your home life, you may find problems arising in the spheres of financial management, and power struggles, and on the emotional levels of relationships. You probably find that your emotions are driven by the force of passion and sexual energy, and that you have a lack of real understanding of their nature, as they tend to be swept along on the tide. Perhaps this is why you often demonstrate little awareness of the emotions of others in everyday life, as yours are often held in a state of suspended repression, like waters blocked from following their natural route by a dam wall. If the emotional level was released carefully and consistently in a healthy way, the blocked Pluto energy operating on that level could be freed, and many of your problems would begin to dissolve, leading to personal transformation. This would then adjust the level of force and suppressed violence in you, so that you would deal with your power more positively. This would lead to a clearer perception of self and others, allowing partners more personal freedom through mutual agreement and compromise, rather than your previous imposition of will. Taking such a course could develop also towards greater social involvement, using your energy in positive and creative channels, realizing that if you can change from living mainly to satisfy purely personal desires at the expense of others, then there is the potential for a self-centered violent society to change from exploitation to co-operation and mutual benefit. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 03:44:14'),

You alternate between moments of intense activity and periods when you cannot seem to gather the energy to accomplish anything. Your temperament is either aggressive or completely apathetic. You find it difficult to maintain a moderate position that would allow you to achieve your goals without ''highs'' and ''lows''. You are the only obstacle in your path to achievement. You need to become self-disciplined in using your energy constructively, and you must establish goals within your reach. Resolve firmly that you will not let feelings of futility keep you from reaching them. You tend to be awed by the accomplishments of your associates or competitors, probably because you give them greater credit than they deserve. You desperately need competition so you can evaluate your own worth; ignorance of your capabilities is your greatest liability. The chances are that others will always have a higher opinion of your potential than you, and you will need to be reassured that your talents are genuine. Once you get over the idea of your unworthiness, you can go far. You must like yourself enough to feel that you deserve the success you can achieve, but you will have to assert yourself. You could find some expression in law enforcement, industrial engineering, military service, conservation, or physical therapy. Initially, you would probably work best alone, until you can convince yourself that you could make a significant contribution in your field. Later, you could work satisfactorily with others without feeling threatened by their competence. You tend to establish goals somewhat out of reach, which makes you unhappy with your accomplishments. It would be better for you to grow into higher levels of responsibility by taking one step at a time. In that way, your current security is never jeopardized. Your personal and romantic relationships never measure up to your expectations. Your desires always seem to be frustrated or to encounter great difficulties. The phrase ''After you get what you want, you don''t want it'' is descriptive of your feelings in these relationships.

If this is expressed through a more integrated consciousness, which is sure of the direction to travel, then its impact can be considerable. If it is manifesting through a less integrated personality, then it can create real problems in life. Again, the revolutionary tendency is very strong, and you will have a natural antipathy towards traditions and static patterns of acceptable social lifestyles. Your attitude will be anti-authoritarian, and you will be iconoclastic in your questioning of the status quo, and critical of those who are in positions of social responsibility and power. Hypocrisy from ''leaders especially upsets you, and you can be scathing in denouncing it. In fact, you probably have developed a fairly demanding set of personal principles and ideals from which you perceive the world. You tend to expect less from ''ordinary people'', acknowledging their frailties; but you expect the highest standards from social leaders. Concepts of social justice, equality and change attract you, and this can draw you into relationships with revolutionary or reactionary political groups. Depending upon the overall bias of the chart, your radicalism could be directed towards a re-creation of past patterns or a new creation to suit future needs and realities. Generally though, with the Uranian impulse it will be future-orientated, and this will lead you to more altruistic liberal and humanitarian groups. Your personality can be very assertive, even aggressive and combative. You have an image of yourself ''at war'' with whatever you disagree with, whether this is just a war that you fight in your own head, or it is one that you externalize by opposing social establishments that you dislike. There is a stimulation for you in conflict; and whilst it may not always be openly displayed, you enjoy competition and intend to win and dominate. This is reminiscent of the Scorpio characteristics, which are reflected through this aspect, with the Mars-Scorpio link and Uranus exalted in Scorpio. The quality of assertiveness could be extrovertedly expressed, stridently and powerfully, or quietly through the power of a strong personal presence. You enjoy arguments and discussions; here the stimulation of ideas, beliefs and attitudes can be enriching. Often you play devil''s advocate on ideas, just to enjoy the sparks that can fly; but if it is on a subject close to your heart, then a more passionate, committed side of you emerges, one that is determined to ''win'' the argument. You oppose in principle any restrictions to individual freedoms, although in practice and with serious consideration, you do tend to impose ''limits'' for valid social reasons. Your main thrust is towards a broadening of personal freedoms, and the creation of more variety and scope for potential experience and opportunity in life. If discipline is imposed upon you, and you feel that you are imprisoned in a stultifying routine, then you will rise to oppose it; however, for your own purposes you can be highly motivated and self-disciplined. Freedom is extremely important to you, and is the key to developing your own uniqueness. You feel that you have to get your own way, and this can cause problems if you are too selfish about this demand. If denied, you feel emotionally frustrated, and this becomes a form of pent-up physical tension, which in extreme cases could result in violence. Tendencies to be arrogant, authoritarian and too self-willed can cause friction in social and intimate relationships. If your lifestyle becomes inhibiting, then this can also create explosions of sudden temper and excessive arguing to release inner pressures. Whilst you see yourself as an outsider, a loner following a personal path, there is an underlying lack of self-confidence, which Scorpio-like is hidden beneath the mask. You insist on finding and making your own way in life, pursuing one''s ''dharma'' (own truth), and will be like the traditional stubborn mule if anyone else tries to lead you against your will. You learn from life''s hard experiences, and indeed, you tend to accept and welcome such intensity and challenges. Often, you will be tempted to throw off the binding shackles of the past, slough off the old skin like a snake, and burn those bridges to leave yourself free to travel forward into the bright future. You seem as though you know what you are doing, and appear to be optimistic, but this is the glow of a belief in your own ability to succeed, to cross those challenging abysses. You may need to unify your will and clarify your desires so that they work more in harmony.

These are often relegated in your sense of priorities; and the more subtle dimensions of them are ignored in favor of the more basic emotional / physical passions and the interests of the mind. Restrictions are rejected in intimate relationships; and a self-preoccupation can dominate and cause later problems. However, you tend to commit yourself to seeing through those decisions that you do take, so a marriage commitment can help to modify these tendencies, provided that your partner is strong enough to encourage you to modify any selfish behaviour in the interests of mutual harmony. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 03:46:37'),

Considered aims and planning are often ignored under the immediacy of impulse and desire; and a spirit of recklessness can ignore any thoughts of the possible future consequences of your actions, provided you believe that your desires will be satisfied. You find it difficult to motivate yourself for long periods of time, as in a commitment to achieve something through careful planning; you have problems in disciplining and directing your will sufficiently for that kind of effort, and you are more suited to using your force in a more immediate, spontaneous impulse for self-satisfaction. This is also partly because you experience some conflict in directing your will to achieve your desires, and rarely feel as though you are making the most of your talents. There can be a sense of inner frustration, caused by the forceful nature of this energy, and a lack of a suitable channel along with to direct it in a constructive manner. This will create a lack of patience, a potentially violent temper and sexual aggressiveness, where you ''throw out'' excess energy through a dictatorial and demanding personality in order to dominate others. You may need to develop a more healthy perspective on sexual expression, one which regards sex more in terms of relationship and partnership, and less in terms of self-satisfaction, energy release, domination, exploitation and aggressiveness. This experience of inner stress is symptomatic of clashing energies; it is not something that you have to endure all your life; it can be adjusted to be more harmonious. One way to begin this reorientation is to learn how to determine the overall direction of your life, to see a broader picture of your immediate social influence and how you want to live in relationship with others. To break down this preoccupation with self and to appreciate and acknowledge the feelings and needs of others as being as valid as your own is essential, and a key to transformation. By becoming clearer as to personal aims, you can begin to apply your will consistently in order to achieve them over time; desires for instant self-gratification are unrealistic. Learn how to live in equality of partnership and relationship; a mutuality of needs, desires and responsibilities requires mutual sharing and co-operation. Avoid tendencies towards domination and power struggles. Basically, you require suitable channels into which to pour your energy, constructive channels that are life-enhancing for you and others.

This is a clash between the familiar patterns of the known and the siren call of the potential of the unknown. This is likely to be felt as a fear of commitment and risk. Whilst you will be attracted towards greater freedom, with the possibility of creating a context where you can be more fully yourself, the likelihood is that you will resist the impulse. As you analyze your options, you prefer to play safe, as you cannot obtain these cast-iron guarantees that you would like as to the future success of your choices. This inner frustration that is likely to build up can cause stress, as a part of your nature is being denied and repressed. You are liable to feel some emotional unease, where you are afraid of allowing full emotional expression, or even properly acknowledging your emotional nature. It is a fear of ''letting go'' that is the root of this difficulty, where emotional or material losses are to be avoided if at all possible. This may have arisen through childhood experiences of loss which deeply affected you, or though a pattern developing that too strongly identified your self with people or possessions, so that with any withdrawal or removal of them from your life, you felt that you were losing part of yourself. You will feel that you need to keep a tight control on life, trying to ensure that chance and predictability are fended off; in this sense, you accept the more grounding energy of Mars, whilst denying the unsettling but potentially liberating energy of Uranus. You apply the Mars energy in terms of conservation, ensuring a protection of your resources through prudent and cautious organization. You intend to apply yourself diligently to your objectives, even if you expect that they will take longer to achieve without taking risks; the problem is that for varying reasons, your intentions often fail to be realized, perhaps through an impatient Uranus unraveling those attempts at persistent effort. Or your interest wanes as you reach a point where a more risky decisive step has to be taken. When that journey of a thousand miles requires the taking of the first step, you may decide not to travel anywhere, preferring established security. Yet you may find that you are willing to allow the Uranian impulse to move freely in your life. This could initially arise as a result of a phase of denial where some external circumstance beyond your control throws you into a period of confusion and turmoil. Redundancy or the sudden collapse of a marriage could be triggers for Uranus to break through that dam. Certainly, it will not be denied expression for all your life, and that side of the square will need to be accepted and integrated. There is potential that even while maintaining your relative control you could safely begin to open up to new horizons, to explore other interests, to expand and liberate your limiting conception of your nature and life. There are strong foundations there, and you should be able to build efficiently upon them. TO achieve those ambitions and personal desires, you will have to take some risks at some point, If you are not committed to achieving them, then it is unlikely that you will ever succeed, because your focus and energy flow will be too diffused and unconcentrated to generate the necessary momentum. That erratic will-power needs to be drawn through into a regular consistent direction. If you can succeed in liberating that inner frustrating tension, you would be surprised how effectively that energy could be applied to reach your aims, instead of clashing within you. Your personal relationships would also improve as the stress began to disperse, and you felt that a great weight was lifting away from your shoulders. Releasing that pent-up, potentially violent energy could mean the dawn of a new era of personal creative enrichment.

You may not have a specific goal in mind - such as a senior managerial position in one company - but could become influenced by ''the inner storehouse'' of innate talents to search for new directions in order to find suitable channels of release for as yet latent gifts; you may even find a problem arising out of the very multiplicity of choices available to you. Ideally, you should look for a ways of life which actually offers you a variety of channels through which to express yourself, where there is a potential for a renewal of challenges and for a demand of personal growth. Working closely with people is likely to attract you, and interpersonal relationships can be a constant sphere of creativity and growth; much can be shared and transmitted even in creating and maintaining positive human relations at work. In an intimate relationship, you should ensure that equality is developed, building a balance, as you may have a tendency to play the role of dominating leader too often. Development of each partner is also important; and you partner''s needs and abilities should be clearly recognized and valued, helping each other to actualize hidden potentials.

You tend to resent and resist any external pressure that can be placed on you by others'' expectations of your performance and abilities. Conflicts often arise in interpersonal relationships, especially with other work colleagues, who may attempt to take advantage of your skills or persuade you to take on responsibilities which may be thankless tasks, or in which for reasons of their own advantage they expect you to fail. There is often a lot of manipulative activity in work places, and you can become a victim of this if you are not aware of the hidden motivations of others. You can become paranoid and suspicious of people, perhaps as a result of previous experience, and there is often a kernel of truth and validity there; yet equally, part of this is a projection emanating from you based on the tensions inherent within this opposition. You tend to either oppose or antagonize others, sometimes by being too direct in your comments and attitudes; there is little social diplomacy in your style of expression, and sometimes you can be very tactless and too adversarial. There can be a blind spot in your character that is often unrecognized, and is related to the sign and house positions of Jupiter and Neptune. Whilst you may fail to fully comprehend your own nature and what you ''should be doing'', you still express yourself forcefully and with a tendency to be authoritarian. Yet you also often challenge the dictates of those in positions of authority, questioning their perceptions and rights to wield power. There is less of a social awareness and conscience here with this aspect, as most of the energy is tied up in an external uneasiness; you do not have any great trust in the good nature of others, which, whilst possibly more realistic, is also symptomatic of your own inner fragmentation and stress - you cannot relax and trust yourself either. You need to learn how to accept others as well as accepting yourself; the two are intertwined, and if you can manage this then stress will be diminished and all your relationships will improve as you correspondingly feel more at ease in your own nature. Intimate relationships can pose difficulties until the step of personal integration and resolution is taken. Your choices of partners may be unwise, especially where those anima-animus projection are superimposed on the partner, apparently turning them into the ideal lover who possesses everything that you believe you desire and need. When these projections collapse, you are liable to be emotionally distraught and see that person as another one who has deceived you; in fact, it may have been your own illusions that have been self-deceptive, and so the consequences of a hurt heart should not be taken out on your partner in any emotional or physical aggression. Resorting to the Neptunian addictions of drugs or alcohol must be avoided at such traumatic times. Some form of religious or spiritual life and aspiration is likely, yet this too can suffer from some distortion and invalid projections. Your spiritual attitudes may lack a practical dimension, or even a serious application by yourself in everyday life. There can be a greater attraction toward the glamours of more exotic religions, which offer a colorful fascination and mystery that appeals. Cultism and an idealized surrender to gurus can be a temptation, despite your resistance to forms of authority, and can seem to offer a way out from the disappointments and stresses of your life. Alternatively, you may dream of foreign travel or pilgrimages across the world as an antidote to the lifestyle you feel trapped within. Realizing that so much of what dissatisfies you in the world is a reflection of an inner lack of integration would be a major step forward. Reabsorbing those powerful projections, allowing yourself to re-own them, can only strengthen you and give you back the ability to redirect your life in ways that you want it to move in. Taking such control and self-responsibility is crucial, unless you want to persist in the likelihood of unsatisfactory relationships with others, where your need for development and expansion is perpetually thwarted by ''external resistance''. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 03:51:13'),

Probably some strained contact with superiors, perhaps your parents, has given you this poor understanding of your capabilities. This is a push-pull planetary combination.

It is in the spheres of judgment and sensitivity that you may find difficulties occurring. Under the expansionist tendencies of both Jupiter and Uranus, you can easily become over-enthusiastic about ideas, business schemes or unconventional beliefs. Allied to an erratic, restless tendency, this can lead you to become involved in highly speculative business ventures where your obsession with the project idea can override any real rational analysis of financial feasibility. Often your attachment to ideas veers towards investing them with elements of fantasy and imagination, which can lack a real applicability within daily life, also adding a distorting factor. There is likely to be some conflict with established traditional beliefs and social attitudes, especially in the areas of religion and politics; and you may become involved with radical politics or more unusual religious and spiritual beliefs. These will hold considerable personal meaning for you; and you will feel impelled to share these with others. Often despite that clever mind, there is an element of simplicity and faith in you, which can become naivety at times. If a belief resonates with that point of imagination within, you can accept it then with little questioning, because really you are looking for a sense of centre and security; and a belief structure appears to offer this. You may need to be wary of an urge to convert others to your beliefs which, whilst genuinely held, may not be suitable for everyone. If others oppose you, this serves to reinforce your support of your beliefs against any odds; you can feel that this often validates them. There can be a tendency to be too domineering in expression, founded on that strong self-assurance; and in relating there is often a lack of tact and sensitivity to the feelings and abilities of others. Not everyone has your ability to be so focused on achieving important objectives; many vacillate, or sit on the fence, instead of choosing to be on one side or the other. Also, others have different requirements for life experience from yours, different challenges; and they may be following their path as much as you are following yours. Eventually, you may find that the Uranus action causes you to revolt against any belief structures to which you have bound yourself. At least for a period, you may have to stand alone and adrift from security in beliefs; this can occur as a result of disillusionment and a collapse in your faith in a specific belief.

(2053, 0, 'us', 'jupiter-sextile-neptune', 7, 'The sextile includes several of the themes of the conjunction, but often develops and defines them more clearly within the individual, and so they are probably more easy to deal with and apply in daily life. In personal relationships, that tendency towards gullibility is still present, aided and abetted by powerful sensitive feelings and emotions that encourage you to believe in the commitment of your partner who satisfies your needs and desires. Your evaluation of the status of your intimate relationships may be unrealistic, and there are bound to be times when your belief in the aptness of your choices is later seen to be merely self-deception; wherever your emotions are involved, they are the source for many illusions and much vulnerability. Standing beside you in the shadows of love is always the prospect of disappointment. Take more time to know someone, be more cautious and check with them how they feel about the relationships too; do not just assume that because you feel in love and happy they feel the same. They may... but the rising divorce rate seems to indicate that the reverse is, regrettably, often the real situation. The theme that is more defined in the sextile is that of optimism, imagination and idealism. The likelihood is that this will be more focused within your mind, and that your lifestyle will reflect this more clearly. In you, faith and trust becomes a more optimistic spirit looking towards future prospects and opportunities. The sphere of expansion is in that direction, and much attention is likely to be paid to contemporary social problems. This vision is probably radical in nature, and often veering to the ''New Age'' perspective. You are alert and aware enough of social conditions, desires and needs, yet you also add a broader perspective to what is currently occurring and what needs to occur in order to build a brighter future. You are capable of an analysis of modern social problems, seeing intrinsic dangers there, and can be articulate in raising these issues. You may become involved in groups that are public voices for such concerns, those minority pressure groups that perform such an essential public service in the Western world. The failings of established political, religious and social power blocs should be recognized, although you may choose to work within them as an influence for inner change. You value individualism highly, and see how others can be unconsciously swept along by powerful ideologies and socially acceptable ways of behaving. This can encourage you to make your own stand against any negative social ideologies that are currently powerful, even those emanating from governments and the churches. You may become a publicist for your ideas and those of affinity groups in an attempt to alert public attention to what is occurring. Idealism will be vitally important to you, and you will feel quite passionate about those ideals. Yet what can let you down is the fact that you are essentially a theorist, in that activity is via a mental perspective, and the ability to ground your vision is often lacking in basic common sense and practicality. At worst, you may recognize social problems, acknowledging that you do have a social responsibility and then fail to take any action about it. Your innate altruistic and humanitarian nature can remain inhibited. If this is happening, and it is partly a symptom of an unintegrated Neptune which dissolves the will to act, then you may need to give yourself a shake. Certainly social change does need visions and theories, but ultimately these have to be anchored on this level, and that inevitably involves a transformation of their nature, often compromising the initial pristine vision. They never come through pure; and they often come through channels and areas of life that are surprising and unexpected. There are ''thinkers and doers'', and ideally the two need to work together, but even the thinkers can become more practical, even if thinking is their real task and not just an excuse for doing nothing. One simple step is to transfer money towards those who are ''doing'' and support them in that way. Or you can evaluate your skills and resources; you should have an articulate imagination, which could be positively applied in the publicizing of vital issues, be inspirational, or express positive social ideals. These are possible channels for you to work along which will be beneficial to yourself and others and will avoid any tendency to retreat into isolated reactive theories, a private monastery of the mind. We can all complain about aspects of life; but the issue is ''what are we doing about them?'' We can all do something, and even if our contribution is apparently small and insignificant, collectively we can make a difference. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 03:53:06'),

It is the potent dream world that you create which is both the source of your creative potential and the cause of your challenges in actual achievement. The problem is that often your dreams remain just dreams, an inner world into which you retreat, a world that you invest much energy in maintaining. Dreaming becomes too addictive for you, and your life becomes just an unrealised dream. This frustration is often caused by a lack of self-discipline and too much self-indulgence and time-wasting. Concentration is poor, and discrimination in decision making can be virtually non-existent at times, as well as being hampered by an unconscious attraction towards flawed ideas and projects. The influences of others are powerful, and you are often pulled from side to side as alluring ideas take control of your dreams. Even when you begin to anchor an idea or intention, what occurs is that it is soon revealed to have flaws, in that faulty logic and reasoning have already eroded firm foundations, and it is seen that those ideas lack real substance and an ability to deliver. Financial awareness is another area where you are rarely at your best, due to the distortions of Neptune and the expansive over-reaching of Jupiter. By unwise actions and lack of preparation, you can create financial problems for yourself quite easily. Your nature is a little other-wordly, running away from the realities of the physical-plane life, and you may have an ongoing struggle to shore up a collapsing ordinary life when your attention has been elsewhere for too long. You tend to become lost in cloudy visions, unable to see clearly through those mists and inner fogs. The real world can feel oppressive and too restricting, and you want to shake it away, yet really you need to properly face it or you will receive many more rude awakenings from those inner dreams. Yet you are often generous and sympathetic with others, having a good heart which is also liable to be abused and taken advantage of by less understanding people. You can lack discrimination towards those in whom you place your faith and trust. That tendency to be gullible and naive will be present, and you may find that others use you as an excuse for their own failings, placing any blame on your shoulders. There can be the ''victim syndrome'' operating through your unintegrated Neptune. Because both of these planets have similar characteristics, it is likely that you will express both of their more negative dimensions. This can cause a blockage in action, hesitancy over decision-making. Relationships can pose problems; distortions and misunderstandings may be common, your consistency questioned, or a liability to be emotionally abused is likely. Offering your heart to unsuitable lovers is probably inevitable at some point. What keeps you going? Dreams.... You dream of exotic adventures, exotic lands, exotic mysteries.

It may be difficult, but facing reality, conforming to its restrictive limitations and learning how to be more practical could be the key to success. Some of those private dreams could become real if you became more concentrated and dedicated to achieving one at a time, instead of withdrawing when the going gets tough. The first step is to become aware of your receptive patterns, to see how they operate, see what consequences occur, see the point where things fall apart. Then, resolve to change that pattern, put more thought into building the dream, more realistic self-evaluation, more discipline and effort placed into making that intention successful. By slowing the process down, and by applying yourself more consciously to what you are doing, you may be able to transform this pattern of frustration into one of future success - it could be well worth the effort.\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 03:54:07'),

There is likely to be a natural religious and spiritual affinity, whether orthodox or unorthodox, and possibly pursued through a more mystical orientation, an interest in occultism, or by your own heightened psychic sensitivity. You tend to recognize that spiritual insight and attitudes can help you to infuse supportive foundations in the lives of those who are responsive, and can enhance meaning, purpose and life direction. These need not be traditional religious philosophies or theology, but are a personal path which unfolds from your own insights and values, emerging from that ability to understand life and people that seems to be a part of you. This approach is less intellectually biased than with the sextile aspect, focusing more on feeling, emotion and intuition, and so the path of the mystic and of contemplative meditation may feel more natural to you. Exalted emotional experiences are of an intensity that you welcome; and it is the evocation of such sensations that can draw you towards communal and religious activities that enhance ceremony, atmosphere, communion and a touch of dramatic mystery. It could be the appeal of the High Church that you find attractive. It is the love and relationship aspect of the spiritual life that motivates you, rather than the knowledge or wisdom dimension, and indeed you may lack discrimination to some degree. Even so, you do succeed in successfully integrating your inspired knowledge so that it is absorbed within your optimistic outlook on life and serves to add richness and variety. There is likely to be a deep sensitivity to your local and world environment, and a strong sense of community spirit. Your basic attitudes are positive and progressive, in that you see the light imprisoned even within the deepest darkness, and have faith that it can be released into constructive activity. It is this essential trust in life and people that can give you strength, both in your own path through life and in supporting others when times are hard and challenging. Your generosity of spirit is one which can be relied upon when friends and family are in need. In several ways, you will both grow and feel fulfilled if you are engaged in service to others, when something real, constructive and positive can emerge from your efforts; and this can lead you into the medical and nursing professions, community welfare and forms of teaching, or into developing beneficial social programs which increase the opportunities for others to release their potential or enjoy life more. Attempts to refine and improve society are likely to be your most effective channels to work through, although you may also do this through creative means, such as art, music and literature, where your expansive imagination can find ways to be anchored in objective forms. You recognize that there are always causes which can benefit from your support and energy, such as international aid organizations. In intimate relationships, ideally you require someone who is essentially compatible with your outlook and attitudes; someone who can understand and respect your sensitivity and refinement, and who acknowledges, values and supports these qualities.

In a few, the spiritual and mystical worlds may be extremely attractive, so much so that the ties of mainstream society fail to bind them into a traditional lifestyle. In such cases, a withdrawal into the world of contemplation may occur; a monastic life or one of non-materialism may greatly appeal. Some prefer to remain free and wander without too many ties or possessions, and adopt a traveling Bohemian lifestyle like the ''New Age travellers'' scattered across the world, free to listen to their own inner inclinations and to experience the boundless nature of Planet Earth by exploring alternative cultures. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 03:55:07'),

The effects of Saturn have a beneficial influence on the tendencies of Neptune, helping definition, stability and ease of expression; the potential is for practical idealism and an ability for positive application of the ideas and imagination emanating from Neptune. This is useful for creativity, as the inspiration of Neptune can be given adequate form and manifestation by the concrete tendencies of Saturn, and so the imagination is not left swirling in an inner world of dreams and fancies but is released onto the physical plane to be shared with others. There is less of the delusive nature of Neptune present with this aspect, and there should be a greater perceptive clarity than usual, one that is especially sensitive to issues of deceit and glamour. You are less prone to make mistakes through such reflective blindness, and tend to be self-protective mainly by a careful and wary distancing that you maintain with strangers or new acquaintances. This is part of the Saturn contribution of caution and unease with anything that is unknown. Trust needs to be progressively developed in you, whether in people, circumstances or situations; and you are usually reticent in making any firm commitments until you have thoroughly evaluated any set of choices. You tend to rely on a faith in facts, and impersonal judging of what seems to be the wisest choice to make; this can be beneficial in your life, privately and in a career. It is probable that the Saturn energy will be the dominant one, with the Neptune energy occasionally repressed for practical reasons. If you allow Saturn to be too emphasized, then opportunities may be lost through excessive evaluation and lack of decisiveness; that fear of the unknown will also act as a restrictive and inhibiting factor. You are likely to erect a well-defined lifestyle and personality structure which allows relatively little space for the Neptunian influence to be expressed, as it is more anarchic and expansionary. What can occur is a sense of confusion regarding your own personal limitations, where they begin to feel imprisoning and Neptune agitates to dissolve those barriers and to experience those repressed dreams that you are attempting to ignore. A careful balancing of both these planetary energies is essential, both for inner harmony and for external success. Otherwise, degrees of distortion and lack of perspective will increase, as the Neptune influence demonstrates its repressed presence through more negative characteristics. For those exploring the spiritual dimension of life, this aspect offers several valuable assets, in that there is a questioning of dogma and assumptions, a tendency to deglamorise through a more earthy perspective, and a developing ability to rely on the inner guidance of intuition rather than on external ''authority sources''. This stage may have been reached as lessons learnt through earlier phases of gullibility and submission to teachers, possibly through religious or parental conditioning which you begin to cast away as inimical to your own development. Discrimination is important in life, and especially so when contacting occult teachings, where the likelihood is that through a lack of real personal experience only genuine ignorance exists; and the tendency of most is to fill that void by passively accepting whatever teaching is making an impact on them. As you continue to develop, especially through standing alone and living through your own light, a greater maturity and perception will unfold. Insight and compassion founded on living experience will be gained, and if you practice meditation techniques then your own power and light is likely to shine brighter as your inner clarity emerges. Effective concentration and meditation should be possible, and some signs of psychic abilities may also emerge from the Neptune energy being released. You may become a channel for the transpersonal energies to enter these levels, and there will be a sense of social responsibility and of the context through which they can operate. Your intimate relationships are likely to be deep and enriching, partly as a result of your careful evaluation of suitable partners; and in those relationships where your heart becomes involved you will tend to be cautious before opening to a full commitment. Relationships are important to you, and you place great emphasis on continually working at them to ensure that they are mutually beneficial and a source of evolutionary growth.

With this aspect, it is likely that you will experience some degree of frustration in achieving your objectives, or a sense of invisible blockages facing you that require you to discover some way to pass them or dissolve them through penetration. As you have a strong ambitious nature, you will need to make full use of all the resources available to you, applying accumulated knowledge and experience to a determined persistent effort to succeed. Patience will be an essential quality for you to develop, as it is unlikely that you will have rapid immediate success in your objectives. Usually you have to wait, and undergo the experience of frustration and not knowing if your goals will be realized; and this can be a testing and transformative phase, especially as it is likely to be repeated periodically throughout your life. You will be attracted towards power and status, although it may be that instead of reaching a position where you ''possess'' such attributes, you are required to gain a new perspective and understanding of influence in the world, rather than demonstrating it yourself. Much depends upon your ability to apply your talents and resources practically; potentially, your ideas and schemes can have a noticeable impact upon the world and your immediate environment, especially when you are working through an established structure and social system. This is because you feel more naturally in tune with existing organizations, preferring traditional approaches and attitudes as a reflection of ''stability and foundation''. You often resist accepting new trends or social changes, as you are inherently wary of them, preferring to follow your established path unless the impulse for change is naturally arising within yourself; and even then the likelihood is that you will attempt to resist and block its movement as a reaction to its unsettling effect. You will have a conservative nature and perception of life, respecting traditions and the consensus social attitudes, being suspicious of those who need to experiment and challenge accepted attitudes. The socially subversive nature of Pluto is unlikely to be too evident, as Saturn will overlay it too much, although it can erupt in your inner and personal life, potentially stimulating a collapse in your ''secure foundations'', forcing you to re-evaluate yourself and your life. Such a radical impact is unlikely, however, unless you are capable of undergoing the cathartic transformation that could occur, because Saturn will maintain your inner structure to prevent this happening. You will be a private person, serious and secretive in nature, not openly revealing your thoughts and particularly your emotions, which you may try to avoid and keep tightly sealed away in a ''locked drawer''. Emotions imply fluctuation and change to you; and this does not fit easily with your world view and perception of self, making you feel uncomfortable. A more healthy approach to emotions should be encouraged, as it would prevent any energy repression on the emotional level, or else you may find that Pluto takes that route to make its presence felt. In intimate relationships, you will be a firm, reliable partner, and you will prefer a traditional approach to marriage and mutual commitment, so you should choose wisely. You will not be overly demonstrative of emotional (on the surface), but you should avoid any tendency to fix the relationship in limiting and binding ties, and instead allow it space to change and evolve. Remember that your partner is a unique individual with a potential to unfold, so allow the necessary freedom for him or her to do so, and encourage the process too. Security in a ''straightjacket'' situation is a false situation, and inimical to growth and development, so despite your tendency in that direction, it is wiser to accept change and unpredictability so that energies can flow healthily. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 03:57:53'),

It offers the possibility of an effective balance between these two antagonistic planets. Apart from those born under this aspect, the energy released into the collective mind at these times can aid in the interplay between forces of order and chaos, conceivably bringing the opposites into equilibrium and allowing a space for something new to be born. For the individual with this aspect, there should be the ability to fuse ideas with practical application, to ground and anchor those sometimes slightly intangible and ephemeral Uranian ideas, thus transferring the, from the level of mind into material existence. You should be able to take advantage of your personal resources and talents; and these can be effectively expressed through efficient organization. The flow of Uranian energy should seem more consistent and reliable; and you will be able to apply persistence and focused will to achieve your objectives. Often, you will find enjoyment from becoming involved in situations where you can create order from chaos. Whilst this may appear Saturnian in nature, Uranus is not chaotic for the sake of it, but is only disruptive in order to create the conditions for a higher order to be superimposed. You can function in a ''bridging role'', carefully restoring a balance between order and change, and re-integrating this into a new structure which is an improvement on the previous one. In modern life, where so many changes are occurring so quickly, such a role can be most important, and utilizes both of these planetary characteristics in a positive way. You have a sympathetic understanding of the past, and of the values and attitudes of conservative stability, yet also intuit and appreciate the necessity of change and evolving of social structures, organizations and individual development. You will try to integrate these threads, uniting what is worth retaining from the past with the ideas of the next step forward. Doing this, you work with both your intellect and intuitional faculties, and so reflect the next stage in human development towards the consciousness of unity. You are likely to prefer a form of expression that involves a social contribution over and above mere participation in society; you would like to feel that you have some influence in improving things, and that your preoccupation is not totally for personal gain. This need can often give you a sense of direction in your life, and one which can absorb both of these planetary energies. If you begin to feel that you are having to keep down inner pressures of certain kinds, perhaps through a lack of channels to release them into, then it is a likely sign that you are not fluently expressing both the energies.

These would stimulate needed changes to happen, and so break down any fixed lifestyle patterns that are becoming inhibiting. If the Saturn energy is repressed, more self-discipline, commitment and perseverance to achieving your objectives would help. If the lifestyle lacks control, too much freedom could also lead to a loss of personal centre and stability, leaving you feeling lost and unsure of what to do or in which direction to travel.

Usually this includes elements of distortion, which with Saturn and Neptune tends to involve fears of failure, suspicions of motives, cloudy judgments, deceit, caution and wariness. These are the more negative qualities of blocked planetary energies, and yet you often fail to realize that the world you are perceiving is a mirror image of your own attitudes. Take another look. Do the world and people reflect your own views? Are they pessimistic and perhaps threatening or frightening? Do you feel that you have to be extremely self-protective? These may, of course, be genuine fears, and can depend on the environment in which you live, but equally they may be illusionary and self-created. This fear of failure is inhibitory to some degree, and it is likely that you will withdraw from situations of competition, retreating into feelings of inadequacy, imagining various types of conspiracy being hatched against you in secret. You don''t really trust people, and that attitude is communicated intangibly to others, so that a vicious circle is perpetuated. Your relationships can lack depth, human warmth and real contact, often staying unsatisfyingly superficial, in that you are afraid that others may take advantage of you. The problem is that this may well happen (or has in the past), and since then you have been too wary and too aware of your vulnerability to risk deeper relationships. Certainly you are vulnerable emotionally and financially to people, and one lesson that may need learning is that you should look closely at the nature of others before you become committed in any way. Saturn''s barriers are firmly established for self-protection, yet they also block many valid experiences and opportunities for self-development. Neptune remains partially released, but liable to display its presence through experiences of persecution and martyr / victim complexes in your life. The results can be that you isolate yourself, become a solitary loner, immune in your imprisoning cocoon of self-protection, perhaps feeling the repercussions of your choice through depressive emotions or psychosomatic illnesses. You can look out onto the world and secretly want status and involvement, yet be self-restrictive in actually attempting to achieve those ambitions. Or you may perhaps resort to cunning, subterfuge and devious behaviour, believing that is the way everyone else achieves their desires. The fact that your world analysis may be incorrect could hold a solution to your frustrated energies. The world holds all shades of behaviour and attitude, and whilst there are many who accurately embody reasons for your cautious perspective, there are others who are not like that at all. You need to find a bridge to contact those people of goodwill, and then you may realize that your interpretation of the world is only partially accurate; the others hold a key to your transformation. If you can find an intimate partner who does not let you down and is supportive, then that frustrated ideal may be reborn, and in accepting another as they are, you discover that this is the way for healing and mutual love to occur. The nature of relationship in your life can be renewed and reperceived through more optimistic eyes; Neptune has replaced the barriers of Saturn. Sometimes Neptune plays a stronger role than Saturn, and if this is the case, then the relationship inhibitions and distortions may be less evident. The focus will be transferred towards that of social duty and obligation, where the lesson deals with responsibility. You may experience a feeling of ''social guilt'', a personal responsibility to put right social evils, a personal crusade which you need to follow in order to absolve yourself from this inner feeling of guilt that haunts you. For some reason, you know that this is your duty, and that some form of social service needs to be done in response to an inner compulsion. Some may consider this to be ''a rectification of karma'', but whatever, it can be an inner pressure and related to the Neptunian tendency to sacrifice in the social sphere of Saturn. The battleground is seen to be the world, but the source of the battle is within your own nature. Check this out thoroughly before you go tilting against any windmills; try to isolate those conditioning projections and discover what you may be really fighting against.

The opposition is often associated with the themes of oppression and violence, physical and psychological, and with the tendency to be a victim of such forms of human negativity on others. For whatever reason, you may feel yourself to be a victim of persecution; and this would color your perception of people and the world, probably making you inwardly defensive and possibly outwardly aggressive towards others as a form of pre-emptive defense. Your ease of self-expression and creativity is likely to be blocked, and you are always wary of revealing too much of yourself to others, in case they begin to take advantage of you; and in any case, you lack self-confidence and inner stability. Emotionally, you may be quite unstable, probably repressing much of your feeling life, because that is what has been damaged previously. This leads you to attempt to create a life of predictability and stability as a counterpoint to those feelings of emotional flux and vulnerability. Certainly you are quite resistant to change, especially within relationships, as you rely on those few close ones in your life to give a sense of security; and because of this fear, you suppress inner movement or outer change until a crisis point is reached where a ''releasing explosion'' is the only way for the blocked energy to move.

You may feel torn between two polarized directions, past-future, order-chaos, orthodox-unorthodox, stability-change. This may make it difficult for you to decide on life directions, or you may become biased towards one pole to the repeated exclusion of the other, and some degree of repression of the ignored planetary qualities will occur. This can give you a hard edge to your personality, which is partly a result of trying to maintain a fixed inner centre against the other inner planetary attraction. You prefer to remain clearly in control, but can express this with what seems to others an overly aggressive approach. There can be a lack of relaxed relationships, partly because you have a competitive attitude and desire to become personally important and authoritative in a social sense. It is doubtful if you will have many close friendships, because of an attitude of exclusion and distancing that you put up around yourself. One area that can create conflict for you is a lack of openness to others, and that attitude of righteous knowing; this can block any real relationship from occurring, and often will generate antagonism from others, who look for opportunities to ''bring you down''. Learning to listen more to what others have to say is one lesson you need to apply; there is something of value to be gained from communication with every person, because the wisdom of the whole is reflected through each individual, and the routes that guidance and messages can take are infinite in variety. If you are not open to the world and people, you will miss them, and just circle around in your own limited world. Life can be greatly enriched by sharing with others in an attitude of equality. Co-operation and compromise should then flow by such an adjustment in your attitude to others, as you break down that restrictive egocentric shell. It is likely that the Uranian energies will be less expressed than the Saturnian ones, so some degree of rebalancing may be required to free that planetary influence. This can be released through personal creativity and allowing yourself to be more free and less tightly bound. This can involve the dissolution of limiting self-images, and an inner granting of freedom to others, so that you do not insist that they conform to your image of them. Often you attempt to direct their lives for them, especially in the more personal sphere of relationships, because it makes you feel able to control life. In the way that you are applying this, the results just inhibit a vibrant life. The Uranian characteristics can also emerge if you become involved in social reforming groups, where you may release that aspect of your nature in an active manner through questioning the Establishment.

This sensitivity to a social role that requires performance is a major component of your motivation, and one that should not really be denied. There can be a tendency to acknowledge its presence and then fail to actually do anything about it, but ideally this should be overcome by more deliberate action. At least you can always help by funding those socially active groups whose ideals you can support. This characteristic is a combination of Saturn duty and the Neptunian social collective ideal. The element of careful discursive planning should be evident where the right foundations for future action are established, and efficient organization is seen as necessary for a successful conclusion. There are likely to be strategic skills which can be exploited in order to achieve those intentions, whether purely personal or socially orientated. Consistency and determination are usually well applied, and your schemes are characterized by their realism and achievability; Neptunian over-expansiveness is tempered by Saturnian caution and a sense of stability and limitation. What can inspire many of your efforts is a reaction against social injustice and foolishness. Fairness is one attitude that you support, and opposing social aspects where unfairness and injustices is being expressed can almost become a personal crusade. Social discrimination and taking social advantage of those unable to resist can cause your passions to rise, leading to social activism designed to resist such encroachments on individual rights and liberties. You dislike seeing the waste of resources, social and material ones as well as the waste of human potential. This can lead to supporting human-potential-raising groups, or ecological activists calling for new attitudes towards the excessive negative exploitation of nature''s reserves.

(2089, 0, 'us', 'saturn-square-uranus', 7, 'The main theme of this square is the likely dominance of the Saturn qualities and a repression of the Uranus ones, with a personality expression being restricted by responding to the Saturn viewpoint on life. This will be seen in a preference for the familiar and known, both in a ready acceptance of social convention (which in its reactionary phase is often rooted in a backwards-looking perception of a ''return to a golden age''), and in the desire for a personal life lived in a controlled, predictable manner and in a stable environment. The personal identity will be focused within strictly defined parameters, with self-imposed limitations on freedom of choice and action, wrapped around with concepts of allowable thoughts, emotions and physical acts. Much of this is a protective guard against the actual insecurity of life, and emerges from a personality that is afraid to relax fully and which is inwardly insecure. Difficulties may arise in life when you are attempting to solve problems by applying existing attitudes which then fail to work. You often find the need for change deeply disturbing, and have an intuitive fear that if you allow that process to occur, then your life would fall apart. When you have to make decisions regarding new situations, you can find it hard to make a final choice, unless you discover a way to do so which reinforces your existing attitudes and preferences; if it involves a new direction, then you become uneasy, trying to find a way to retreat back towards your old familiar patterns. In those attempts to impose control on life, you can be too dictatorial or authoritarian in your relations with others, perhaps through an insistence upon your point of view being right, or in having everything done in an established manner without deviation. Your life can become highly patterned, locking you into a circumscribed experience of life. This can define your identity for you, offering a way for you to evade those feelings of insecurity and lack of real confidence; but this will restrict you taking advantage of many opportunities in life. Often, you seek social status or approval in order to gain a reflected sense of self-worth. Denying the Uranian vibration of change can lead to problems of life adaptation and inner tensions, especially as there will be an underlying struggle between an affinity with traditional patterns and an attraction and fear of something new being released into your life. Saturn will embody the more inflexible end of the square; and if you begin to respond to Uranus (or a transit stimulates its activity), then these inhibiting patterns will begin to be eroded and destroyed. Part of you - a repressed aspect - would secretly love to break free of all binding ties, to become unconventional and liberated; if the pressures rise too strongly, then attempts to throw off self-imposed shackles may be made, just to release the tensions. Marriages and careers can be destroyed through such activity, with the end result being a collapse of existing patterns with no real comprehension of how to build a more suitable lifestyle, and just a feeling of an inner void and loss of direction being common. Ongoing transformation is the wisest course of action, as the transitions move more smoothly and the person is capable of slowly adjusting to new ways in a more harmonious manner, integrating the arising new tendencies more successfully and easily. Even within these Saturnine confines, the Uranian undercurrent is at work. The operation of your mind - where you focus yourself in order to control life - is more inconsistent and contradictory than you believe. Others probably notice this; but you will oppose any attempts to point this out to you, in your belief in your logic and rationality.

Sometimes, the strains of living with denied aspects can make you touchy in relationships, where people have to treat you in certain ways so as to avoid ''triggering those buttons'' which stimulate areas in you that you choose not to explore. For real health, these need to rise into the light, so that the pressures and energies can be released, and that you can integrate parts of your being.

The effects of Saturn have a beneficial influence on the tendencies of Neptune, helping definition, stability and ease of expression; the potential is for practical idealism and an ability for positive application of the ideas and imagination emanating from Neptune. This is useful for creativity, as the inspiration of Neptune can be given adequate form and manifestation by the concrete tendencies of Saturn, and so the imagination is not left swirling in an inner world of dreams and fancies but is released onto the physical plane to be shared with others. There is less of the delusive nature of Neptune present with this aspect, and there should be a greater perceptive clarity than usual, one that is especially sensitive to issues of deceit and glamour. You are less prone to make mistakes through such reflective blindness, and tend to be self-protective mainly by a careful and wary distancing that you maintain with strangers or new acquaintances. This is part of the Saturn contribution of caution and unease with anything that is unknown. Trust needs to be progressively developed in you, whether in people, circumstances or situations; and you are usually reticent in making any firm commitments until you have thoroughly evaluated any set of choices. You tend to rely on a faith in facts, and impersonal judging of what seems to be the wisest choice to make; this can be beneficial in your life, privately and in a career. It is probable that the Saturn energy will be the dominant one, with the Neptune energy occasionally repressed for practical reasons. If you allow Saturn to be too emphasized, then opportunities may be lost through excessive evaluation and lack of decisiveness; that fear of the unknown will also act as a restrictive and inhibiting factor. You are likely to erect a well-defined lifestyle and personality structure which allows relatively little space for the Neptunian influence to be expressed, as it is more anarchic and expansionary. What can occur is a sense of confusion regarding your own personal limitations, where they begin to feel imprisoning and Neptune agitates to dissolve those barriers and to experience those repressed dreams that you are attempting to ignore. A careful balancing of both these planetary energies is essential, both for inner harmony and for external success. Otherwise, degrees of distortion and lack of perspective will increase, as the Neptune influence demonstrates its repressed presence through more negative characteristics. For those exploring the spiritual dimension of life, this aspect offers several valuable assets, in that there is a questioning of dogma and assumptions, a tendency to deglamorise through a more earthy perspective, and a developing ability to rely on the inner guidance of intuition rather than on external ''authority sources''. This stage may have been reached as lessons learnt through earlier phases of gullibility and submission to teachers, possibly through religious or parental conditioning which you begin to cast away as inimical to your own development. Discrimination is important in life, and especially so when contacting occult teachings, where the likelihood is that through a lack of real personal experience only genuine ignorance exists; and the tendency of most is to fill that void by passively accepting whatever teaching is making an impact on them. As you continue to develop, especially through standing alone and living through your own light, a greater maturity and perception will unfold. Insight and compassion founded on living experience will be gained, and if you practice meditation techniques then your own power and light is likely to shine brighter as your inner clarity emerges. Effective concentration and meditation should be possible, and some signs of psychic abilities may also emerge from the Neptune energy being released. You may become a channel for the transpersonal energies to enter these levels, and there will be a sense of social responsibility and of the context through which they can operate. Your intimate relationships are likely to be deep and enriching, partly as a result of your careful evaluation of suitable partners; and in those relationships where your heart becomes involved you will tend to be cautious before opening to a full commitment. Relationships are important to you, and you place great emphasis on continually working at them to ensure that they are mutually beneficial and a source of evolutionary growth.

In particular, you enjoy restoring ''order from chaos'' and making use of forgotten and ignored resources. There can be a tendency to sit back and observe social decline and contentious issues without choosing to become more actively involved, but this would be a waste of your own talents and a denial of that sense of social obligation. Your idealism has strong moral and ethical roots, and you could feel uncomfortable if you ignored those inner promptings. Direct activism may not be your preferred mode of involvement, but you may find your role perhaps through communicating to others the facts about certain problematic social issues, especially through the medium of writing and analysis. You tend to have an absorbent intelligence, which accumulates considerable information and knowledge easily, and which is a resource that you should be able to utilize. The level of imagination is high and active, and this too can be personally used in a variety of ways, giving a spark of life to the ideas that you have for personal and social development. You may have difficulty in deciding exactly how to use your own resources, and the ideal may be to become involved in work which has a definite social dimension. Such work can include community welfare, law, social services, environmental concerns, finance, management, media, film, photography.

Neptune inspires you towards compassionate feelings, both for people you know and for strangers. If the spiritual quality of Neptune is active (and not so overshadowed by a dominating Saturn), then you are likely to be attracted towards spiritual or occult groups, where your talents can find ways of expression.

With this aspect, it is likely that you will experience some degree of frustration in achieving your objectives, or a sense of invisible blockages facing you that require you to discover some way to pass them or dissolve them through penetration. As you have a strong ambitious nature, you will need to make full use of all the resources available to you, applying accumulated knowledge and experience to a determined persistent effort to succeed. Patience will be an essential quality for you to develop, as it is unlikely that you will have rapid immediate success in your objectives. Usually you have to wait, and undergo the experience of frustration and not knowing if your goals will be realized; and this can be a testing and transformative phase, especially as it is likely to be repeated periodically throughout your life. You will be attracted towards power and status, although it may be that instead of reaching a position where you ''possess'' such attributes, you are required to gain a new perspective and understanding of influence in the world, rather than demonstrating it yourself. Much depends upon your ability to apply your talents and resources practically; potentially, your ideas and schemes can have a noticeable impact upon the world and your immediate environment, especially when you are working through an established structure and social system. This is because you feel more naturally in tune with existing organizations, preferring traditional approaches and attitudes as a reflection of ''stability and foundation''. You often resist accepting new trends or social changes, as you are inherently wary of them, preferring to follow your established path unless the impulse for change is naturally arising within yourself; and even then the likelihood is that you will attempt to resist and block its movement as a reaction to its unsettling effect. You will have a conservative nature and perception of life, respecting traditions and the consensus social attitudes, being suspicious of those who need to experiment and challenge accepted attitudes. The socially subversive nature of Pluto is unlikely to be too evident, as Saturn will overlay it too much, although it can erupt in your inner and personal life, potentially stimulating a collapse in your ''secure foundations'', forcing you to re-evaluate yourself and your life. Such a radical impact is unlikely, however, unless you are capable of undergoing the cathartic transformation that could occur, because Saturn will maintain your inner structure to prevent this happening. You will be a private person, serious and secretive in nature, not openly revealing your thoughts and particularly your emotions, which you may try to avoid and keep tightly sealed away in a ''locked drawer''. Emotions imply fluctuation and change to you; and this does not fit easily with your world view and perception of self, making you feel uncomfortable. A more healthy approach to emotions should be encouraged, as it would prevent any energy repression on the emotional level, or else you may find that Pluto takes that route to make its presence felt. In intimate relationships, you will be a firm, reliable partner, and you will prefer a traditional approach to marriage and mutual commitment, so you should choose wisely. You will not be overly demonstrative of emotional (on the surface), but you should avoid any tendency to fix the relationship in limiting and binding ties, and instead allow it space to change and evolve. Remember that your partner is a unique individual with a potential to unfold, so allow the necessary freedom for him or her to do so, and encourage the process too. Security in a ''straightjacket'' situation is a false situation, and inimical to growth and development, so despite your tendency in that direction, it is wiser to accept change and unpredictability so that energies can flow healthily. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:02:49'),

It offers the possibility of an effective balance between these two antagonistic planets. Apart from those born under this aspect, the energy released into the collective mind at these times can aid in the interplay between forces of order and chaos, conceivably bringing the opposites into equilibrium and allowing a space for something new to be born. For the individual with this aspect, there should be the ability to fuse ideas with practical application, to ground and anchor those sometimes slightly intangible and ephemeral Uranian ideas, thus transferring the, from the level of mind into material existence. You should be able to take advantage of your personal resources and talents; and these can be effectively expressed through efficient organization. The flow of Uranian energy should seem more consistent and reliable; and you will be able to apply persistence and focused will to achieve your objectives. Often, you will find enjoyment from becoming involved in situations where you can create order from chaos. Whilst this may appear Saturnian in nature, Uranus is not chaotic for the sake of it, but is only disruptive in order to create the conditions for a higher order to be superimposed. You can function in a ''bridging role'', carefully restoring a balance between order and change, and re-integrating this into a new structure which is an improvement on the previous one. In modern life, where so many changes are occurring so quickly, such a role can be most important, and utilizes both of these planetary characteristics in a positive way. You have a sympathetic understanding of the past, and of the values and attitudes of conservative stability, yet also intuit and appreciate the necessity of change and evolving of social structures, organizations and individual development. You will try to integrate these threads, uniting what is worth retaining from the past with the ideas of the next step forward. Doing this, you work with both your intellect and intuitional faculties, and so reflect the next stage in human development towards the consciousness of unity. You are likely to prefer a form of expression that involves a social contribution over and above mere participation in society; you would like to feel that you have some influence in improving things, and that your preoccupation is not totally for personal gain. This need can often give you a sense of direction in your life, and one which can absorb both of these planetary energies. If you begin to feel that you are having to keep down inner pressures of certain kinds, perhaps through a lack of channels to release them into, then it is a likely sign that you are not fluently expressing both the energies. Look at your life pattern and see which one is being repressed.

These would stimulate needed changes to happen, and so break down any fixed lifestyle patterns that are becoming inhibiting. If the Saturn energy is repressed, more self-discipline, commitment and perseverance to achieving your objectives would help. If the lifestyle lacks control, too much freedom could also lead to a loss of personal centre and stability, leaving you feeling lost and unsure of what to do or in which direction to travel.

The conjunction is quite rare, being made the last time around 1848, a time of social revolution in Europe and a time of great civil unrest and social change in Europe and America, and occurring again in the period of 1963-68. The influence of these potent transpersonal planets is likely to be radical and far-reaching, setting a trend for the following century to develop and integrate, one which requires a long period of time for society to assimilate. In that sense, the influence is world-wide, and the period in which the close conjunction is made should be carefully analyzed to perceive the essential thrust of this directive energy and the emergent trends for social development over the next hundred years. With the cosmic periodic releasing of such powerful energies, the human reaction to them is varied and often polarized in response. These reveal the interface between the individual life and the collective life of a society. It is as though from a multiplicity of sources a new alluring voice is rising, which is revealing a new approach to life for society to absorb. Certain individuals respond enthusiastically to this new siren call, embracing ''the new way'', and begin to group together as an influential minority within their own society. They then reflect the new ideas, impregnate society with them and act as transmitters of change. Broader social reaction to ''the new way'' is often slow, apart from the inevitable reaction against the new trend; and often society attempts to use the power of its established structures to resist what appears to be a threatening impulse. The influence of the conjunction is to initiate a new phase of social change; and during the 1963-68 aspect, it is that of a revolutionary new spirit in the air, extolling the virtues of individual rights and freedom, stimulating the need for the transformation of the existing social establishment and the breakdown of outdated and limiting social and national attitudes and engrained patterns of thinking. For those who were (and still are) attuned and receptive to this visionary energy, there is a personal feeling of involvement in a vast process of evolutionary development occurring on earth, a feeling that their individual life is intimately linked with a vast plan slowly unfolding into manifestation, and that their lives are guided by some greater consciousness, participants in a planetary drama. AS a world-wide group held together by shared response, they collectively form a conduit for the new social approach to be mediated into human life and consciousness. Some reflect this in a more conscious manner, by seeking to manifest the overshadowing energy via deliberate meditation or occult rituals, etc.. What is of importance to this group is the respect and value of life in all of its forms, ranging from human life to animals, plants, all of the many appearances of Nature, and the abundant creativity of Earth. Life is viewed as essentially ''holy'', to be cherished, respected, enjoyed and protected. It is a basic attitude to life that wants the highest quality of life for everyone, founded upon a balanced and careful relationship with the environment and the natural world, whereby human society moves from being a dangerous exploiter of nature''s gifts to living in a more natural harmony. Individually, there is the need to develop as a unique person, free to live and express oneself within a peaceful, co-operative co-existence, to learn how to unfold innate potentiality without it infringing on the rights of others.

Usually this includes elements of distortion, which with Saturn and Neptune tends to involve fears of failure, suspicions of motives, cloudy judgments, deceit, caution and wariness. These are the more negative qualities of blocked planetary energies, and yet you often fail to realize that the world you are perceiving is a mirror image of your own attitudes. Take another look. Do the world and people reflect your own views? Are they pessimistic and perhaps threatening or frightening? Do you feel that you have to be extremely self-protective? These may, of course, be genuine fears, and can depend on the environment in which you live, but equally they may be illusionary and self-created. This fear of failure is inhibitory to some degree, and it is likely that you will withdraw from situations of competition, retreating into feelings of inadequacy, imagining various types of conspiracy being hatched against you in secret. You don''t really trust people, and that attitude is communicated intangibly to others, so that a vicious circle is perpetuated. Your relationships can lack depth, human warmth and real contact, often staying unsatisfyingly superficial, in that you are afraid that others may take advantage of you. The problem is that this may well happen (or has in the past), and since then you have been too wary and too aware of your vulnerability to risk deeper relationships. Certainly you are vulnerable emotionally and financially to people, and one lesson that may need learning is that you should look closely at the nature of others before you become committed in any way. Saturn''s barriers are firmly established for self-protection, yet they also block many valid experiences and opportunities for self-development. Neptune remains partially released, but liable to display its presence through experiences of persecution and martyr / victim complexes in your life. The results can be that you isolate yourself, become a solitary loner, immune in your imprisoning cocoon of self-protection, perhaps feeling the repercussions of your choice through depressive emotions or psychosomatic illnesses. You can look out onto the world and secretly want status and involvement, yet be self-restrictive in actually attempting to achieve those ambitions. Or you may perhaps resort to cunning, subterfuge and devious behaviour, believing that is the way everyone else achieves their desires. The fact that your world analysis may be incorrect could hold a solution to your frustrated energies. The world holds all shades of behaviour and attitude, and whilst there are many who accurately embody reasons for your cautious perspective, there are others who are not like that at all. You need to find a bridge to contact those people of goodwill, and then you may realize that your interpretation of the world is only partially accurate; the others hold a key to your transformation.

The nature of relationship in your life can be renewed and reperceived through more optimistic eyes; Neptune has replaced the barriers of Saturn. Sometimes Neptune plays a stronger role than Saturn, and if this is the case, then the relationship inhibitions and distortions may be less evident. The focus will be transferred towards that of social duty and obligation, where the lesson deals with responsibility. You may experience a feeling of ''social guilt'', a personal responsibility to put right social evils, a personal crusade which you need to follow in order to absolve yourself from this inner feeling of guilt that haunts you. For some reason, you know that this is your duty, and that some form of social service needs to be done in response to an inner compulsion. Some may consider this to be ''a rectification of karma'', but whatever, it can be an inner pressure and related to the Neptunian tendency to sacrifice in the social sphere of Saturn.

For whatever reason, you may feel yourself to be a victim of persecution; and this would color your perception of people and the world, probably making you inwardly defensive and possibly outwardly aggressive towards others as a form of pre-emptive defense. Your ease of self-expression and creativity is likely to be blocked, and you are always wary of revealing too much of yourself to others, in case they begin to take advantage of you; and in any case, you lack self-confidence and inner stability. Emotionally, you may be quite unstable, probably repressing much of your feeling life, because that is what has been damaged previously. This leads you to attempt to create a life of predictability and stability as a counterpoint to those feelings of emotional flux and vulnerability. Certainly you are quite resistant to change, especially within relationships, as you rely on those few close ones in your life to give a sense of security; and because of this fear, you suppress inner movement or outer change until a crisis point is reached where a ''releasing explosion'' is the only way for the blocked energy to move. As with the square, you need to initiate a process of inner change, to transform the restrictive attitudes and self-image that act as a frustrating factor in your life. Somehow, you need to develop more personal confidence so that you can begin trusting more, and feel secure enough to come to terms with your feelings and emotions, to allow them to fertilize and water those inner barren lands. Through such an approach, Pluto can act to give you a new birth, to almost resurrect you from the dead and to allow you the opportunity to enjoy life much more fully and appreciatively. Your inner life is not fixed in unchangeable stone, as the prospect of transformation is ever-present in every life. Initially, it may be difficult to dissolve such long-established barriers; but it can be done, enabling a new you to flower and fulfill your hidden potential\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:06:01'),

These tensions arise as a result of the clash of the Saturn and Uranus energy patterns within you, and will continue to remain operating until you succeed in resolving the causes of the inner friction, through transforming the relationship of Saturn to Uranus. You may feel torn between two polarized directions, past-future, order-chaos, orthodox-unorthodox, stability-change. This may make it difficult for you to decide on life directions, or you may become biased towards one pole to the repeated exclusion of the other, and some degree of repression of the ignored planetary qualities will occur. This can give you a hard edge to your personality, which is partly a result of trying to maintain a fixed inner centre against the other inner planetary attraction. You prefer to remain clearly in control, but can express this with what seems to others an overly aggressive approach. There can be a lack of relaxed relationships, partly because you have a competitive attitude and desire to become personally important and authoritative in a social sense. It is doubtful if you will have many close friendships, because of an attitude of exclusion and distancing that you put up around yourself. One area that can create conflict for you is a lack of openness to others, and that attitude of righteous knowing; this can block any real relationship from occurring, and often will generate antagonism from others, who look for opportunities to ''bring you down''. Learning to listen more to what others have to say is one lesson you need to apply; there is something of value to be gained from communication with every person, because the wisdom of the whole is reflected through each individual, and the routes that guidance and messages can take are infinite in variety. If you are not open to the world and people, you will miss them, and just circle around in your own limited world. Life can be greatly enriched by sharing with others in an attitude of equality. Co-operation and compromise should then flow by such an adjustment in your attitude to others, as you break down that restrictive egocentric shell. It is likely that the Uranian energies will be less expressed than the Saturnian ones, so some degree of rebalancing may be required to free that planetary influence. This can be released through personal creativity and allowing yourself to be more free and less tightly bound. This can involve the dissolution of limiting self-images, and an inner granting of freedom to others, so that you do not insist that they conform to your image of them. Often you attempt to direct their lives for them, especially in the more personal sphere of relationships, because it makes you feel able to control life. In the way that you are applying this, the results just inhibit a vibrant life. The Uranian characteristics can also emerge if you become involved in social reforming groups, where you may release that aspect of your nature in an active manner through questioning the Establishment. What you may have to be wary of is a bias towards Uranus that leads to losing the awareness of the essential Saturn values in life. What you should be aiming towards is a way to create a workable balance between these energies within your own nature and through relationships, so that the positive aspects of each can shine through. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:06:19'),

This sensitivity to a social role that requires performance is a major component of your motivation, and one that should not really be denied. There can be a tendency to acknowledge its presence and then fail to actually do anything about it, but ideally this should be overcome by more deliberate action. At least you can always help by funding those socially active groups whose ideals you can support. This characteristic is a combination of Saturn duty and the Neptunian social collective ideal. The element of careful discursive planning should be evident where the right foundations for future action are established, and efficient organization is seen as necessary for a successful conclusion. There are likely to be strategic skills which can be exploited in order to achieve those intentions, whether purely personal or socially orientated. Consistency and determination are usually well applied, and your schemes are characterized by their realism and achievability; Neptunian over-expansiveness is tempered by Saturnian caution and a sense of stability and limitation. What can inspire many of your efforts is a reaction against social injustice and foolishness. Fairness is one attitude that you support, and opposing social aspects where unfairness and injustices is being expressed can almost become a personal crusade. Social discrimination and taking social advantage of those unable to resist can cause your passions to rise, leading to social activism designed to resist such encroachments on individual rights and liberties. You dislike seeing the waste of resources, social and material ones as well as the waste of human potential. This can lead to supporting human-potential-raising groups, or ecological activists calling for new attitudes towards the excessive negative exploitation of nature''s reserves.

If actually applied in the world, the tendencies which are associated with the sextile would help bring about social improvement and clarity within government and publicly representative bodies. It invokes a natural voice of the people to object against social injustice and hypocrisy, to resist dictatorial abuses of power and influence emanating from central government, and to expose corruption whenever it occurs in high places. It embodies the dichotomy between the individual and the State, wherein the State should reflect the democratic will of the people, and be the elected servant of the people, and yet in real life becomes an independent entity dominated by power-blocs and influential political parties which perceives itself to be superior to the people and often ignores their demands. The political ?lite is often quite dismissive of the general public, believing that it has the machinery and power to manipulate the social consciousness as it wills, and invariably wishes that what often passes as democracy did not exist to get in its way. Unfortunately, the analysis of public apathy and the ?lite''s ability to manipulate social attitudes is often correct, and serves as a reactionary barrier to social progress.

This was the second phase of post-war children, born into a time of relative stability and reconstruction, when the memories of the war were ebbing away into past history, even though the Korean War was rekindling some of them. This group received a psychic impression from the collective, which embodies a form of social confusion then prevalent which was reflective of the collective mind. Social direction was the issue. The defeat of Churchill''s government after the ending of the war, a government which seemed to represent the past, and the introduction of the post-war Labor reformist policies such as the Welfare State seemed to herald a new vision and direction. But the collective was torn between dreams and fears of a new world, and a rejection of painful memories of man''s inhumanity; a clash between the future and the past, the unknown and the known. Reflecting this collective conflict, the individuals born at the time received a pattern of rebellion (Uranus) which was mixed with confusion (Neptune) over what to do, which direction to travel in, how to achieve objectives, even what these objectives actually were. The only model that could be absorbed was that of their parents and peers, which offered conflicting and confusing social messages. The problem in later life would become ambivalence; they would be torn between a need to revolt against authority and the establishment, and a need to feel socially secure. Purity of ideals would become a challenge, especially when confronted with the pragmatic demands of economic and family life. With this aspect there is an aversion to leaders, who, it is felt, lead people into blind obedience and conformity, which to the Uranian spirit is anathema and opposed to the Uranian principle of freedom. Personal freedoms are paramount, and their repression may lead to a struggle to assert them. Yet this group eventually fragmented into various types. Some were reluctant revolutionaries, eventually being reabsorbed into the social ''mainstream''; some were ''rebels without a cause'', social misfits with no direction except that of aggressive reaction. Members of this aspect group were attracted to the existing hippie and drug counter-culture, in the later phase after 1968; others became early leaders of the mid-seventies'' punk movement, an anarchic reactionary youth revolt against conformity; and perhaps most significant of all became part of the spreading of the New Age movement which incorporates the ecological Green political groups. In fact, many of those who were early adherents of the hippie ideals have become part of the New Age culture, which is expanding throughout society through alternative health therapies, mind training, healthy foods, and an ideology of individual and collective wholeness. It is in this way that the core group of those born during the period 1952-6 is active in taking control of their own lives and influencing society. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:10:55'),

The consequences of this inner pressure and disquiet tend to create feelings of inadequacy, incompetence and inferiority.

The close square applied from 1931 to 1934; and the phase was of rapid metamorphosis in crucial countries like Germany and Italy. These were two clear examples of the impact of the Uranian-Plutonian energy, where nationalistic tendencies and ?litist attitudes were elevated into a sense of social direction, manipulated by dictatorial groupings in an attempt both to seize power and to benefit the State by introducing new political concepts. The power complex and need to dominate of the unregenerated Pluto energy is displayed in the need to expand their control and influence into other less powerful nations, through ruthlessly expressed violence and force. The general world economic instability helped to create the space for radical and revolutionary political agitators to gain power, feeding off the exploited energy of will (Pluto) to build an apparently attractive edifice of the new society. In many cases, this basic urge to create new social structures was genuinely held by those whose motives and ideals were socially beneficial; however, they were to lose their positions of responsibility to those whose intentions were more mixed, and who were being swept along by their receptiveness to the powerful energies pouring into the world, which served to over-stimulate aspects of their unintegrated personalities. The collective group responding to the Fascist and Nazi ideals was generating and reflecting the possessing energy, especially through the group mind and seen in those emotionally manipulated and invocative mass public rallies, which were similar in effect to certain types of magical ritual. There were two main ways in which people reacted to the social change occurring. One was to collaborate with it, being excited and thrilled by active participation in a national resurrection, irrespective of some of its hidden darker aspects. The other way was to be apathetic and passive, allowing it to go on all around hem, feeling insecure and unable to have any influence even if they disagreed with he dominating group. What became paramount in this square was the stimulation of the unconscious national mind and emotions by Pluto, which overrode the more intellectually idealistic mind quality of Uranus. All those repressed tendencies rose into physical view, those attitudes of superiority, of national frustration, of harsh, sadistic dismissal of other ''inferior'' races, and of the power of violent aggression, became integrated into the expression of the new society; and freedom was ignored by the might of the oppressor.

There is a form of linking between your personal unfoldment and growth and the struggles of mass humanity, one which you may experience or interpret in a peculiarly masochistic manner, or use as an excuse for personal failings. Some of this tendency could arise from earlier life and parental relationships and conditioning, possibly from environmental deprivation of lack of fulfilling and meaningful contact with your parents and family.

(2128, 0, 'us', 'saturn-square-uranus', 7, 'The main theme of this square is the likely dominance of the Saturn qualities and a repression of the Uranus ones, with a personality expression being restricted by responding to the Saturn viewpoint on life. This will be seen in a preference for the familiar and known, both in a ready acceptance of social convention (which in its reactionary phase is often rooted in a backwards-looking perception of a ''return to a golden age''), and in the desire for a personal life lived in a controlled, predictable manner and in a stable environment. The personal identity will be focused within strictly defined parameters, with self-imposed limitations on freedom of choice and action, wrapped around with concepts of allowable thoughts, emotions and physical acts. Much of this is a protective guard against the actual insecurity of life, and emerges from a personality that is afraid to relax fully and which is inwardly insecure. Difficulties may arise in life when you are attempting to solve problems by applying existing attitudes which then fail to work. You often find the need for change deeply disturbing, and have an intuitive fear that if you allow that process to occur, then your life would fall apart. When you have to make decisions regarding new situations, you can find it hard to make a final choice, unless you discover a way to do so which reinforces your existing attitudes and preferences; if it involves a new direction, then you become uneasy, trying to find a way to retreat back towards your old familiar patterns. In those attempts to impose control on life, you can be too dictatorial or authoritarian in your relations with others, perhaps through an insistence upon your point of view being right, or in having everything done in an established manner without deviation. Your life can become highly patterned, locking you into a circumscribed experience of life. This can define your identity for you, offering a way for you to evade those feelings of insecurity and lack of real confidence; but this will restrict you taking advantage of many opportunities in life. Often, you seek social status or approval in order to gain a reflected sense of self-worth. Denying the Uranian vibration of change can lead to problems of life adaptation and inner tensions, especially as there will be an underlying struggle between an affinity with traditional patterns and an attraction and fear of something new being released into your life. Saturn will embody the more inflexible end of the square; and if you begin to respond to Uranus (or a transit stimulates its activity), then these inhibiting patterns will begin to be eroded and destroyed. Part of you - a repressed aspect - would secretly love to break free of all binding ties, to become unconventional and liberated; if the pressures rise too strongly, then attempts to throw off self-imposed shackles may be made, just to release the tensions. Marriages and careers can be destroyed through such activity, with the end result being a collapse of existing patterns with no real comprehension of how to build a more suitable lifestyle, and just a feeling of an inner void and loss of direction being common. Ongoing transformation is the wisest course of action, as the transitions move more smoothly and the person is capable of slowly adjusting to new ways in a more harmonious manner, integrating the arising new tendencies more successfully and easily. Even within these Saturnine confines, the Uranian undercurrent is at work.

For real health, these need to rise into the light, so that the pressures and energies can be released, and that you can integrate parts of your being. If you choose not to, it is likely that at some point in life, Uranus will erupt with a vengeance, and sweep away all those pretences, patterns and controlled lifestyle, forcing you to confront your denied selves and to change. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:11:42'),

This tends to condition their perception of life and people, which in effect can sometimes veer towards pessimism and cynicism, especially if they were born in the early years of the trine when the world war was at its height and the result still hung in the balance. Underlying this is still the idealism of these planets, but with possibly insufficient personal faith in their actual manifestation, together with an ambiguity about their own personal role and responsibility in society. There can be a tendency to follow personal goals irrespective of social needs and obligations, and a preference for personal gain and ambitions. Yet this too can be a source of personal development, and it is still perhaps too early yet to be sure how such individuals will use any social power and influence that they may have acquired.

They have grown up in a rapidly changing world, though childhood conditioning would still reflect pre-war attitudes; they are thus able to serve as mediators in society, knowing the older world and yet attuned enough to the dawning of the new world. There should be sufficient intellectual capacity for them to evaluate the implications of ideological belief structures for themselves, without the imposition of authority; this should result in the development of genuinely held personal views irrespective of their nature and content. If they don''t feel convinced, after careful consideration of the validity of an idea or belief, they will usually be unable to give whole-hearted support for it - unless they compromise themselves for personal gain.

In addition, new political approaches emerged as Fascism, National Socialism, Communism, all founded on ''new'' ideals and ideologies, and yet all often demonstrating an outlook liable to cause international conflict, despite their domestic social improvements benefiting their own people. Change was in the air; many were responding to its heady effect, trying to take advantage of the energies recently released to them; and there is a feeling of a searching and experimentation during a time of crisis and transition, when little seemed clear and definite, and most seemed part of an international melting-pot, the results of which could define the direction of the future. There was an acceptance of breaking free of the past, becoming open to all new ideas and developments; some welcomed this with excitement, as cultural and social structures began to dissolve or lose their predominant places; some found the changes disturbing, feeling the sands beneath their feet changing too rapidly to feel secure.

The conjunction is quite rare, being made the last time around 1848, a time of social revolution in Europe and a time of great civil unrest and social change in Europe and America, and occurring again in the period of 1963-68. The influence of these potent transpersonal planets is likely to be radical and far-reaching, setting a trend for the following century to develop and integrate, one which requires a long period of time for society to assimilate. In that sense, the influence is world-wide, and the period in which the close conjunction is made should be carefully analyzed to perceive the essential thrust of this directive energy and the emergent trends for social development over the next hundred years. With the cosmic periodic releasing of such powerful energies, the human reaction to them is varied and often polarized in response. These reveal the interface between the individual life and the collective life of a society. It is as though from a multiplicity of sources a new alluring voice is rising, which is revealing a new approach to life for society to absorb. Certain individuals respond enthusiastically to this new siren call, embracing ''the new way'', and begin to group together as an influential minority within their own society. They then reflect the new ideas, impregnate society with them and act as transmitters of change. Broader social reaction to ''the new way'' is often slow, apart from the inevitable reaction against the new trend; and often society attempts to use the power of its established structures to resist what appears to be a threatening impulse. The influence of the conjunction is to initiate a new phase of social change; and during the 1963-68 aspect, it is that of a revolutionary new spirit in the air, extolling the virtues of individual rights and freedom, stimulating the need for the transformation of the existing social establishment and the breakdown of outdated and limiting social and national attitudes and engrained patterns of thinking. For those who were (and still are) attuned and receptive to this visionary energy, there is a personal feeling of involvement in a vast process of evolutionary development occurring on earth, a feeling that their individual life is intimately linked with a vast plan slowly unfolding into manifestation, and that their lives are guided by some greater consciousness, participants in a planetary drama. AS a world-wide group held together by shared response, they collectively form a conduit for the new social approach to be mediated into human life and consciousness. Some reflect this in a more conscious manner, by seeking to manifest the overshadowing energy via deliberate meditation or occult rituals, etc.. What is of importance to this group is the respect and value of life in all of its forms, ranging from human life to animals, plants, all of the many appearances of Nature, and the abundant creativity of Earth. Life is viewed as essentially ''holy'', to be cherished, respected, enjoyed and protected. It is a basic attitude to life that wants the highest quality of life for everyone, founded upon a balanced and careful relationship with the environment and the natural world, whereby human society moves from being a dangerous exploiter of nature''s gifts to living in a more natural harmony. Individually, there is the need to develop as a unique person, free to live and express oneself within a peaceful, co-operative co-existence, to learn how to unfold innate potentiality without it infringing on the rights of others. Some twenty years after the close conjunction, the attitudes released into the world at this time were still serving as a necessary social direction; and many pressure groups had been formed to further the progress of such causes. The succeeding century needs to see more development for the benefit of mankind. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:13:59'),

If actually applied in the world, the tendencies which are associated with the sextile would help bring about social improvement and clarity within government and publicly representative bodies. It invokes a natural voice of the people to object against social injustice and hypocrisy, to resist dictatorial abuses of power and influence emanating from central government, and to expose corruption whenever it occurs in high places. It embodies the dichotomy between the individual and the State, wherein the State should reflect the democratic will of the people, and be the elected servant of the people, and yet in real life becomes an independent entity dominated by power-blocs and influential political parties which perceives itself to be superior to the people and often ignores their demands. The political ?lite is often quite dismissive of the general public, believing that it has the machinery and power to manipulate the social consciousness as it wills, and invariably wishes that what often passes as democracy did not exist to get in its way. Unfortunately, the analysis of public apathy and the ?lite''s ability to manipulate social attitudes is often correct, and serves as a reactionary barrier to social progress. However, one tendency of this aspect is to expect and insist upon a high quality of governmental leadership, a belief that those in positions of authority and social influence should express the highest ideals, morals and values of the society they represent; if not, they should be replaced. A shift in this direction, assuming such quality people made themselves available, could stimulate a major change in society; it is a prerequisite for the new vision to appear in the future.

This was the second phase of post-war children, born into a time of relative stability and reconstruction, when the memories of the war were ebbing away into past history, even though the Korean War was rekindling some of them. This group received a psychic impression from the collective, which embodies a form of social confusion then prevalent which was reflective of the collective mind. Social direction was the issue. The defeat of Churchill''s government after the ending of the war, a government which seemed to represent the past, and the introduction of the post-war Labor reformist policies such as the Welfare State seemed to herald a new vision and direction. But the collective was torn between dreams and fears of a new world, and a rejection of painful memories of man''s inhumanity; a clash between the future and the past, the unknown and the known. Reflecting this collective conflict, the individuals born at the time received a pattern of rebellion (Uranus) which was mixed with confusion (Neptune) over what to do, which direction to travel in, how to achieve objectives, even what these objectives actually were. The only model that could be absorbed was that of their parents and peers, which offered conflicting and confusing social messages. The problem in later life would become ambivalence; they would be torn between a need to revolt against authority and the establishment, and a need to feel socially secure. Purity of ideals would become a challenge, especially when confronted with the pragmatic demands of economic and family life. With this aspect there is an aversion to leaders, who, it is felt, lead people into blind obedience and conformity, which to the Uranian spirit is anathema and opposed to the Uranian principle of freedom. Personal freedoms are paramount, and their repression may lead to a struggle to assert them. Yet this group eventually fragmented into various types. Some were reluctant revolutionaries, eventually being reabsorbed into the social ''mainstream''; some were ''rebels without a cause'', social misfits with no direction except that of aggressive reaction. Members of this aspect group were attracted to the existing hippie and drug counter-culture, in the later phase after 1968; others became early leaders of the mid-seventies'' punk movement, an anarchic reactionary youth revolt against conformity; and perhaps most significant of all became part of the spreading of the New Age movement which incorporates the ecological Green political groups. In fact, many of those who were early adherents of the hippie ideals have become part of the New Age culture, which is expanding throughout society through alternative health therapies, mind training, healthy foods, and an ideology of individual and collective wholeness. It is in this way that the core group of those born during the period 1952-6 is active in taking control of their own lives and influencing society. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:19:32'),

The close square applied from 1931 to 1934; and the phase was of rapid metamorphosis in crucial countries like Germany and Italy. These were two clear examples of the impact of the Uranian-Plutonian energy, where nationalistic tendencies and ?litist attitudes were elevated into a sense of social direction, manipulated by dictatorial groupings in an attempt both to seize power and to benefit the State by introducing new political concepts. The power complex and need to dominate of the unregenerated Pluto energy is displayed in the need to expand their control and influence into other less powerful nations, through ruthlessly expressed violence and force. The general world economic instability helped to create the space for radical and revolutionary political agitators to gain power, feeding off the exploited energy of will (Pluto) to build an apparently attractive edifice of the new society. In many cases, this basic urge to create new social structures was genuinely held by those whose motives and ideals were socially beneficial; however, they were to lose their positions of responsibility to those whose intentions were more mixed, and who were being swept along by their receptiveness to the powerful energies pouring into the world, which served to over-stimulate aspects of their unintegrated personalities. The collective group responding to the Fascist and Nazi ideals was generating and reflecting the possessing energy, especially through the group mind and seen in those emotionally manipulated and invocative mass public rallies, which were similar in effect to certain types of magical ritual. There were two main ways in which people reacted to the social change occurring. One was to collaborate with it, being excited and thrilled by active participation in a national resurrection, irrespective of some of its hidden darker aspects. The other way was to be apathetic and passive, allowing it to go on all around hem, feeling insecure and unable to have any influence even if they disagreed with he dominating group. What became paramount in this square was the stimulation of the unconscious national mind and emotions by Pluto, which overrode the more intellectually idealistic mind quality of Uranus. All those repressed tendencies rose into physical view, those attitudes of superiority, of national frustration, of harsh, sadistic dismissal of other ''inferior'' races, and of the power of violent aggression, became integrated into the expression of the new society; and freedom was ignored by the might of the oppressor.

This tends to condition their perception of life and people, which in effect can sometimes veer towards pessimism and cynicism, especially if they were born in the early years of the trine when the world war was at its height and the result still hung in the balance. Underlying this is still the idealism of these planets, but with possibly insufficient personal faith in their actual manifestation, together with an ambiguity about their own personal role and responsibility in society. There can be a tendency to follow personal goals irrespective of social needs and obligations, and a preference for personal gain and ambitions. Yet this too can be a source of personal development, and it is still perhaps too early yet to be sure how such individuals will use any social power and influence that they may have acquired. As the trine is a reconciling factor, this generation could be seen as a ''bridging group'' where both the past and future tendencies co-exist, probably uncomfortably at times. They have grown up in a rapidly changing world, though childhood conditioning would still reflect pre-war attitudes; they are thus able to serve as mediators in society, knowing the older world and yet attuned enough to the dawning of the new world. There should be sufficient intellectual capacity for them to evaluate the implications of ideological belief structures for themselves, without the imposition of authority; this should result in the development of genuinely held personal views irrespective of their nature and content. If they don''t feel convinced, after careful consideration of the validity of an idea or belief, they will usually be unable to give whole-hearted support for it - unless they compromise themselves for personal gain. They are aware of the dangers of gullibility and a lack of public discrimination regarding leaders - as the German people in World War II demonstrated - yet are not fully convinced by the intent of any leaders who use truth as an expedient to be employed only when it suits them.

The acknowledgement of the necessity of this is displayed in the economic instability and collapse in America and Germany, the British Depression, and the initial creation of the new Communist r?gime in Russia. In addition, new political approaches emerged as Fascism, National Socialism, Communism, all founded on ''new'' ideals and ideologies, and yet all often demonstrating an outlook liable to cause international conflict, despite their domestic social improvements benefiting their own people. Change was in the air; many were responding to its heady effect, trying to take advantage of the energies recently released to them; and there is a feeling of a searching and experimentation during a time of crisis and transition, when little seemed clear and definite, and most seemed part of an international melting-pot, the results of which could define the direction of the future. There was an acceptance of breaking free of the past, becoming open to all new ideas and developments; some welcomed this with excitement, as cultural and social structures began to dissolve or lose their predominant places; some found the changes disturbing, feeling the sands beneath their feet changing too rapidly to feel secure. Those under the trine''s influence felt that the tide of history was moving with them, and that no obstacle could stand in their way for long. The traditional ways were considered outdated and restrictive; and they were looking for something new in which they could discover some form of personal meaning; and they flocked to support the new emergent political philosophies with emotional enthusiasm, as they appeared to embody the new world that they felt was imminent. The Uranus-Pluto trine acted as a channel for energies to stimulate national characteristics, and to dissolve the power of tradition and the past. It had a jarring effect on the world, initially received as what can now be perceived as a destructive and deluding force, yet one which was necessary to clear the ground for the more constructive influence to emerge. It gave a boost to scientific and intellectual development in the West, yet stimulated a relatively immature emotional level in society, which found early security by becoming part of mass emotional support for those charismatic demagogues that rose to the forefront of the political arena. In some ways, the effects of the trine are the direct opposite to those of the previous opposition aspect at the turn of the century, 1900-1903, almost as if the ''turning of the screw'' creates even more social confusion and conflict within the period of the World Wars.

This can, however, be an ambivalent tendency. You may be correct in your intuition, discerning the signposts of your path; yet equally, this could become a path of evasion if you believe that it offers a justification for self-centered choices, or if you assert personal freedom to the point where you wander through life with no sense of a clear direction. One of your main assets is an innate self-confidence which generates a powerful faith in your ability to attain aims successfully. Through positive thinking you can attract ''good fortune'' into your life, naturally expecting that all will work to your benefit. Usually, your positive attitudes will prove effective, yet there will be occasions when over-optimistic tendencies may stretch your actual capabilities too far, and you experience temporary setbacks to your plans.

Work involving the initial impulse for transformative social projects may particularly suit you, and offer ample scope for ongoing development. Linking your path with social needs could be an appropriate action and wise choice. You enjoy expressing personal creativity and imagination, feeling that energy flowing into new forms and channels, sparking off new thoughts, directions and perceptions. Discovering a path which evokes self-motivation is very important, enabling that enthusiastic energy to be released. You like to be well-informed, and will be aware of most current social trends and world news.

Some may not appreciate your endeavors though, and you may need to recognize when your efforts will fall on stony ground.

You will probably experience an ongoing challenge of self-confidence and of establishing a suitable and satisfying lifestyle and sense of purpose. The nebulous influence of Neptune''s sea mists tends to confuse you, dissolving many of your intentions away, and making your sense of individual identity almost transparent at times as that personality centre seems to ebb and flow in tune with an inner tidal rhythm. Because of an inner experience associated with insubstantiality, you can lack the strength of a firm and fixed individuality, and this has the effect of diminishing confidence regarding your actual capabilities and will to achieve any objectives. You can find it hard to be consistent and to persevere through self-discipline and application for long periods of time. Your identity can appear to be periodically submerged by the powerful Neptune energy, dissolving plans and ambitions, and then leaving you washed ashore in another inner place wondering what to do next even before you have completed the last project.

There is a tendency to build a private reality, one which excludes the dark sides of self and the world, establishing a veiled and limiting perspective of life which only generates activity by additional repression into the unconscious mind. Personal responsibility is avoided if possible, and all experiences are filtered through this restrictive veil, a state that if prolonged leads to inner and outer alienation. Often these forms of self-delusion emanate from personal desires, emotions and sensitive feelings, as Neptune is associated with the plastic and pliable astral level.

Careers in management, politics, law, scientific research, teaching, local government may be attractive, especially if you are able to use an ability to assume responsibility within your employment. Your earlier childhood development will have been influenced by the relationship to your father. Look at the attitudes towards life that your parents expressed, and see if these have become your dominating attitudes and values too. You may have received a highly ordered and strict parental discipline, encouraging conformity to parental desires and codes of conduct; moralistic or religious attitudes may have conditioned your worldview. There may have been a lack of parental approval or response to your unique childhood nature, perhaps a lack of emotional affinity (perceived or actual) which made you feel more isolated and independent; certainly you would have experienced an early inner maturation process. Have you become what your parents wanted you to be? And is this in accordance with your desires and dreams? You may need to break free from these earlier psychological programs that are still operating in you, so that you can move in new directions or transcend those restrictions in life that are acting as barriers to fulfillment and success. You have much of value to share with the world, but this may need greater releasing. For instance, you may feel that everyone makes their own destiny (and certainly, to some degree this is correct), but this should not stop you being generous if you have financial abundance in your life; you could help others to help themselves. There may be a belief that there is a lesson or message within every life experience, but this should never stop feelings of love and friendliness flowing out naturally from you to others. Acknowledging others in a different way may be necessary, so that you are more aware of their needs and qualities, and this can divert you from your self-preoccupations. Certainly you will require a compatible intimate partner who recognizes your need for achievement, and who is willing to support your endeavors; but equally, you should not forget that your partner also has their own life path to follow, and you should not forget their needs either. Mutual aid is the ideal approach. Loosen the chains of your self-imposed limitations, and you may be surprised by how your life can favorably change.

I have particularly noticed this with Sun-Descendant clients, for they seem to take more than usual notice of what might be said during a consultation, tending as they do to ascribe far too much importance to the views and opinions of others at the expense of their own and frequently looking to other people to make their decisions for them. The astrologer-client relationship, like any other counseling situation, is based on equality and sharing. If one person could be said to be more ''important'' than the other, then that person is clearly the client. In the most extreme instances, the person with Sun in the 7th, when in the role of client, is reluctant to accept this fact. He / she gives away his / her importance, fights shy of the limelight, and tries to manipulate the situation so that the counselor is centre-stage and the one pulling the strings in the client''s life. Where this does happen, it is usually repeating a situation that has been created in their other partnerships, whether personal relationships or working partnerships. All too easily, the Sun-Descendant person can believe that his / her life is fated and that he / she is merely a pawn in the hands of the heavens or of others'' superior power. This is not always the case, of course, but certainly Sun-Descendant, rather like a Sun Libran, does like to share the decision-making process and does like someone to do things with. Relationship and partnership are very important to this type. It''s a good placement for people who work in a partnership, and indeed for anyone who works in a one-to-one situation. In some cases, the Sun-Descendant might say ''I am nothing without a partner; life has no meaning without another person''. More positively, Sun-Descendant people might say ''I find myself through close interaction with another person''. This is a very good placement for analysts, therapists and the like. They can find their identity through close interaction with another person, and, similarly, in a one-to-one situation they can enable others to shed light on themselves. They may even achieve personal distinction and recognition through relationship. It''s a common placement in the charts of lawyers too; they often work in partnerships, and on each case they work in partnership with their clients; usually, also, lawyers are involved in litigation with ''open enemies'', and are working, ideally, for justice and fairness. The father of the person with Sun on the Descendant was usually viewed by the individual more as a husband to the mother than a father to the child. Sometimes this is literally true, where the father-figure in the home during the formative years is not in fact the biological father; but usually this is more the psychological experience than the actual one. Father was concerned with being a partner (in the marital or business sense) above all else. If the Sun is in the 7th house, the individual will seek through marriage a relationship with the father archetype, either by playing the role of father or by expecting the ''other'' to do it for him / her. If the Sun is in the 6th house, the individual considers working partnerships to be especially important. In any event, the individual is usually ''fathering'' others in the sense of providing some sort of identity for them. Descendant-Sun people are proud of their partnerships. This is the type who, aged 70 or 80, can be found linking arms with their spouses and stating proudly that they have been married fifty years or so. It is not that relationships are more likely to last with the Sun conjunct the Descendant, or that it is necessarily a good thing if they do, or even that the relationships will be necessarily better than any other people''s.

There is little tranquility in your world; it becomes more of a battlefield where you believe you can ''win your spurs'' proving your capabilities. You are fired by the competitive spirit, intending to win and be number one, although the quality of your aggressive vibration tends to attract similar people into your life, and this can result in power struggles in working or domestic environments. Applying extra force may leave you in a position of superiority, yet can also increase the number of adversaries that you leave in your wake; your genuine friendships can be few if you act in this manner. You have a powerful desire nature, and you easily become fixated on attaining these desires, whether they are lovers, positions of executive status, or whatever, even if your energies are focused only temporarily in such specific directions. These desires can reflect the themes of the houses and signs of Mars and the Sun, and often contain the issues that you feel most combative about. There can be an aura of ''danger'' surrounding you, possibly with a sexual magnetism and aggressive power that some can find extremely attractive, although this energy can overflow through displays of irascible temper and potential violence if uncontrolled. You are very physically responsive, and will have a developed visual and sensual appreciation of life. You may have to ensure that your desires do not become compulsive or obsessive in nature. In relationships, you may lack sensitivity to others'' feelings and needs, and may need to transform expectations of a partner so that they conform more closely to a realistic appreciation, rather than providing fuel for later disillusionment. A wise choice of partner is required; otherwise your domestic life could become volatile and traumatic; a partner who evokes your higher nature and qualities is probably more ideal than one who just stimulates your passionate and vigorous nature. Finding a suitable companion, who is strong enough not to allow you to dominate, would probably help in modifying your attitude towards life. A danger can lie in a tendency to make impulsive decisions or actions, and then regret them later. It may be that experience eventually influences you to make changes in your style of expression, and this may not occur until later in life, perhaps after the age of thirty and through developing maturity.

This is why you desire to be in a position of authority, calling the tune and writing the rules, yet are so rebellious when roles are reversed; you then use your influence to be subversive and manipulate others to resist authority. You will feel a desire to change the world into your image, reflecting the way that you think it should be.

If you attempt to dictate to people, by forceful expression, you may easily fail to get the right kind of support and co-operation, especially if it is made clear that you intend to be the kingpin and final arbiter. The problem with dominating and forceful personalities is that usually they insist on having their own way, and are rarely, if ever, wrong.

Yet equally they can become extremely positive qualities to be used in socially creative ways once excess self-interest is transcended, and you move towards the higher solar path of your individuality rather than just satisfying lower egoic needs and desires.

The issue of self-esteem and worth is highlighted, and you may experience a degree of hidden insecurity and fears of full involvement in life. You may feel that your success is being frustrated by the world, which appears to confront you by obstacles on your way. Much depends on your reactions to such experiences, and your inner attitudes will determine how you deal with them. At times, you can seem almost over-assertive or aggressive, and this can diminish opportunities for co-operative endeavors to develop, especially when you fail to notice your effect on others, or inadvertently ignore their feelings and sensitivities. Often this is just an overreaction to your fears in relating to people, and instead of relaxing more, you tend to project through your tightness an over dominant energy that others can find uncomfortable. Alternatively, you could retreat back into a surrendered posture of passivity to life''s challenges, defeated before you start. Certainly learning how to live with any restrictions imposed by Saturn may be a necessary form of adjustment, although this should not imply a resignation to them, but merely a conscious modification to circumstances and a consequent step to transcend them later. The choice is yours to reshape your lifestyle patterns into a way that is more suitable and open to development. Self-expression and creativity may feel restricted, although this is often dependent on your confidence in your abilities and self-image, rather than on any lack of talents and qualities. Being able to perceive yourself in a positive light may become a key to your success, because that would also alter your relationships with others. There may be an emotional reserve and lack of warmth in your social contacts, so that you feel uncomfortable in bridging social divides and entering deeper relationships. Co-operation may need further development, and that air of formality and strictness may have to be relaxed so that friendships or partnerships can be more easily formed. The need for relaxation is present in both your outer and inner relationships. You may be unable to see your nature and direction clearly and this creates an insecurity which destabilizes your self-esteem. Personal tightness and control may need to be relinquished, and greater self-relaxation would be highly beneficial, especially in changing certain attitudes and increasing your physical vitality which periodically can become low as the energy is diverted towards restraints. Becoming looser, more tolerant, accepting and understanding would act as a great liberator, or you may begin to bow under the strain of those self-imposed restrictions, especially as your enjoyment of life progressively diminishes.

(2221, 0, 'us', 'sun-opposition-uranus', 7, 'Both square and opposition aspects have a peculiar quality which is similar to an ''on-off switch''. Internal and external erratic behavior may be expected, which can lead to those dramatic and often drastic changes of behavior and lifestyle. Within your hidden inner life, you are likely to feel undercurrents of restless activity, which, while peaking and troughing, are an ever-present participant in your nature. This can lead to nervous tensions and irritability, and an edgy tone to your energy which is often psychically communicated or received by others and experienced as an intangible sense of unease. Your emotional and mental moods are erratic, unpredictable and temperamental, creating sudden confusing changes and relationships, or even contradicting statements that you have just made. sometimes you may fail to be aware of this lack of continuity that you exhibit. Individuality and independence will be emphasized, with insistence upon your own needs and freedom from all restrictions. This can manifest as a compulsion to display a rebellious antisocial attitude, mainly as a reactionary explosion of energy rather than any considered response which could also offer some viable alternative ways to follow. Your reactions are likely to be more negative in quality and content, and may need a conscious degree of self-moderation to avoid an instinctive ''knee-jerk'' response. You may find that you obtain pleasure from seeing others react to your iconoclasm, as it can add some excitement to life, but it is unlikely to be inherently creative or positive action as you often fail to have anything of value which could replace whatever it is you are opposing. In many ways you are insecure, feeling lost and frustrated with both the world and yourself. Your inner energy flow is uneven; sometimes you are highly charged and have difficulties dealing with that; other times the energy seems to be switched off, and life goes flat and colorless. You probably lack a stable cohesive centre, missing the positivity of an adjusted planetary relationship to your Sun, and you may need to struggle towards establishing a firm, secure point of balance within your identity. You can be hypersensitive, but may tend to deny this aspect through feeling uncomfortable with your emotional nature and its ebb and flow, as this does not fit into that intellectualized self-image that you have developed. This can be quite delusory, but is also a prop for you to centre your identity around. These images can include considering yourself ''before your time'', an unrecognized genius or artist, a cultural bohemian, a radical revolutionary, an important social adversary. Glamorous images emerge from that high opinion of yourself and those peculiar insights and ideas that you attempt to communicate to others. There are likely to be some nuggets of gold scattered around, but more often than not you fail to deliver, wisps of intentions dematerializing into the air. Your evaluations are often impractical, and due to diversions towards new glamorous ideas, or to an unfocused will, you often fail to develop fully any natural gifts. While you tend to insist that your will is paramount, you really need to learn effective forms of social compromise, realizing your misapprehension of being the all-important centre of the universe, which is symptomatic of an imbalanced Sun. Just learning to listen seriously to other points of view and perceptions on life can teach you much, in distinction to one of your behaviour patterns which sees such contact and communication as a form of competitive challenge, mentally pitting yourself as an adversarial opponent of another point of view. You may need to stop tilting against windmills. Your heroic quest should not be externally directed, but internalized in an attempt to achieve an inner transformation. This is not to imply that the windmills are not there - they probably are - but you need an effort to redirect and redistilling your nature and energies so that your solar centre becomes more powerful and integrative. A redefinition of rebellious spirit needs to be made by you, a re-channeling of your scattered energies. Learning forms of relaxation or meditative techniques could become very important to your well-being, and may help in this re-centering process of evoking the solar power. Highly strung nervous states are not beneficial to health. Relationships can also be fraught with problems, as your erratic hot and cold contributions are not always made in apt timing for your partner''s behaviour patterns. You may need to be wary of making excessive emotional demands, especially as you may not be so balanced in your emotional nature, and you probably have a lack of understanding of that level. In many ways, it is likely to be an immature aspect of your nature, and may require conscious development and further exploration.

Seeking wealth may not engage your wholehearted participation, but the abundance and prosperity of a suitable lifestyle will attract your creative endeavors.

This issue of selfish versus selfless actions is one which may confront you, influencing your decisions and motivations. The art of visualization is a powerful merging of mind-will-imagination, and is the source of creation. Your sensitivity to others and world pain will be strong, connected to a reasonably well-developed awareness of social responsibility, where by empathic feelings you believe that you should and could aid in the alleviation of human suffering. Yet this psychic absorption of pain can also make you turn away from actually doing anything about this social awareness, so you may register and acknowledge its existence yet attempt to deny your role in healing. It is unlikely that you will be capable of dealing with the causes of suffering, but you may prefer to hold a soothing and healing balm to the symptoms of the pain. You hope that others who are stronger and perhaps less sensitive than yourself will deal with the negative causes in society. You may be of value by communication inspiration, perhaps through writing for publication or through the media. Linking your grasp of social responsibility with a good dramatic expression could bring aspects of society that need transforming to the attention of others; crusading journalism and TV documentaries are prime examples of such work. This is an asset that you could apply; and, if you choose to develop this, then your imagination and inspiration will be rekindled. This need to maintain relationships with people, which also involves a broader social sphere than that of just friendship, is a route through which Neptune works, leading you towards your solar purpose.

There is an element of a chameleon nature about you, a malleability enabling you to fit into a variety of situations and social scenes, an inner flexibility whereby your attitudes and expression mould themselves to any specific environment and take over from deeper personal preferences. This is a Neptunian water quality in your personality, where you ''take the shape of any container''. It can be advantageous, yet equally can lead to losing your distinct identity due to repeated chameleon transformations. This may therefore need to be carefully monitored or guarded against if your personality begins to fragment and dissolve; although, if you are following a mystical path, your aim becomes dissolving into the ''ocean'', where the droplet of the separate self loses all boundaries and disappears into the universal ocean of life. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:47:29'),

You believe that life has an inner meaning of great value, and continually search for the threads of this throughout your life, trusting in the belief that life is good, often despite appearances. This is part of your quest for the spiritual dimension of your solar centre, and will draw you increasingly closer to that integrative heart of your nature. However, you are aware of the darker sides of existence, and feel inspired to try to improve the quality of life for those who suffer or for the following generations. At times, especially perhaps after any disappointments on your path, you may coolly withdraw from relationships or social involvement. See this only as a temporary phase for re-evaluation. You need to communicate with like minds, sharing experiences, insight and knowledge. This may easily develop over time into forms of teaching where through sharing you can contribute towards progress for others, and this could become a fulfilling route for you to follow to embody a higher solar purpose. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:47:57'),

(2239, 0, 'us', 'sun-square-jupiter', 7, 'This implies confronting frustrations which have their roots in your nature and attitudes, and which can only be resolved through changes and modifications within yourself. The Jupiterian quality of expansiveness is very potent, stimulating excess expansion in your actions and attitudes, tempting you consistently to overreach your actual capabilities. You may lack patience, planning abilities, self-discipline and persistence, and these will work against your ambitions succeeding, even though attaining your aims may be highly motivating. It is not that you are incapable of success, but that your approach sows seeds of future failure as you pass. If this has happened in your life, then acknowledge it, and realize that future progress can be made if certain inner changes are taken. The first step is to ensure that you determine your intentions and aims, and how you can proceed to accomplishment. As your desires and dreams can be varied and multiple, focusing your path may prove difficult, and you may need to pursue a thorough re-evaluation of your priorities and major needs in order to gain clarity of purpose. Moving too quickly can often lead to failure due to ill-considered plans, so you may need to stop and think more deeply before jumping into action, or pay more attention to the advice of others. A careful assessment of your current capabilities is required, so that they match the level needed for your goals; working with talents tends to expand latent potential, but a requisite level of skills is initially necessary. A more realistic appreciation of time is essential, or else you will feel your frustrations rising if success does not happen quickly. Excessive optimism and enthusiasm may need to be warily reined back, as do restless tendencies for changes in life, which can become more disruptive than helpful unless properly understood. The areas of life especially affected are the houses and signs which are ruled and occupied by the Sun and Jupiter, and it is through those spheres that you may over-expand or seek fulfillment within. If you sincerely wish to transform any pattern of frustration in your life, then becoming more realistic, mature and self-controlled will begin to show benefits, especially if you are systematically disciplined to overcome obstacles as they arise. Accepting that failure need never be permanent, or that success is never final or guaranteed, can offer you a more balanced perspective to view your progress. Modifying your attitudes towards life challenges so that they become opportunities for development and growth, instead of perpetuating attitudes of adversarial conflict imposed by a universe intent on thwarting your dreams, will ensure that every experience can bring something of potential value to use as a foundation for your eventual success. Balance and moderation may need to be consciously developed in your nature and life-style, and extravagance or ostentatious tendencies may need to be controlled due to that pattern of excessive consumption that could be adopted as a compensation for other areas of personal failure. Learning to use your energies and time carefully is important, as you may waste them by futile pursuits. Unlocking latent creative potential may be difficult, yet if you can do so this may open several new doors of opportunity, liberating blocked inner energies and providing the key to future success. In relationships, you may need to guard against tendencies to manipulate people, as this will rarely work to your ultimate advantage; there will always be some other puppet master capable of pulling your strings. Similarly, attempts to distort information for your own aims will equally be turned back against you by others also adroit at such tactics. Treating people honestly and directly is the best approach, and you should possess good communication skills which could be applied to transform blockages and obstacles. You may find that if you rely solely on your ''luck'' your progress will be restricted; but if you begin to change those problematic attitude areas and approaches then ''luck'' will begin to flow again in your favor. You have high expectations in intimate relationships, especially centered around the fulfillment of your needs and desires; remember that it takes two to make partnership and marriage, and that there is no law that asserts that your needs are paramount. Real love involves mutual sharing and co-operation, each helping to make the other happy, fulfilled and capable of reaching his / her highest potential; it should not be a one-way traffic. Co-operation and interdependence may need developing, through a diminution of the insistent demands of your ego; otherwise, excessive self-indulgence can stimulate problems of health and corresponding illness. Make sure that your expectations and demands of a partner are equal to your own contribution, and to the degree of commitment and effort that you are applying to make the relationship work.

(2243, 0, 'us', 'sun-square-neptune', 7, 'This indicates tendencies of psychologically based inhibitions, restrictions and frustrations which pose considerable challenges that need overcoming before the more positive characteristics of Neptune and the Sun emerge. You tend to lack confidence in your identity and ability to achieve your ambitions. Part of this may have been derived from your parental relationships, especially with the father, as your developing nature may have experienced conflict through lack of understanding or of perceived love; it may have been that by asserting your own individuality you clashed with the stronger parental will. The results are that your self-confidence has fragmented, and that your application of will is less focused and effective, and consequently you have developed psychological defenses against others and from facing personal failure. This is displayed in escapism, and avoidance of responsibilities and of the need for self-discipline, unless a powerful Saturn in your chart can re-balance this tendency. Preferring to run away from confronting reality leads to distorted perceptions, which make careful evaluation of options difficult as well as generating fears of making decisions which may prove to be unwise. At its worst, this can create inertia through fear of taking deliberate action. These inner images of failure tend to create external failures, and so emphasize a repetitive vicious circle. Yet by linking this pattern of failure within aims and ambitions that are probably beyond your current capabilities to achieve, you also succeed in evading the realization that you are creating most failures in your life. This is exacerbated by the dreams of the unintegrated and unfulfilled Neptune, who may be noticed as a thread of guilt related to your lack of achievement, and as an ongoing sensation of discontent. Your solar power is being diverted and dissolved by the activity of an unintegrated Neptune, and, unless you can begin to reassert this solar centre and face your Neptunian challenges, this unsatisfactory condition may continue. These challenges can be mitigated by a decision to make sufficient effort to connect to your hidden solar centre, to move beyond those superimposed images of guilt, failure and inferiority that have developed as a defensive response to emotional pain. Such a reorientation may not be easy to make, as you will be opposing established patterns of behaviour, yet the gains that can be made are likely to transform your life. The first step is self-acceptance, to cease any self-judgment and condemnation. Then, if you really want it to happen, feel confident that any change can occur. You have sufficient inner creativity, imagination and potential waiting to be released from imprisonment, although finding appropriate channels of expression may still take a little longer. However, you need to define any ambitions within a more realistic perspective than previously. Possibly some form of counseling may be effective in helping you gain more clarity regarding your self-potential, or workshops in self-assertion and decision-making / goal-setting. In effect, you are being asked to see yourself as a young child, ready to enter adulthood, and you are expected to recreate yourself into a new and more suitable identity. Take smaller and easily achievable steps in this process of recreation; acknowledge that occasional failures are inevitable, but try not to turn them into traumatic dramas, and realize that success will not happen without the parallel risk of failure side by side. Everybody is a failure at something, and that isn''t an excuse to condemn yourself again. As your self-confidence grows, your life will begin to take a more positive shape. It will not happen overnight, as transforming long-established behaviour patterns cannot be achieved that quickly; but persevere, and changes can happen. Perhaps using techniques like creative visualization and affirmations, or subliminal programming encoded on self-development cassette tapes, could strengthen this process. The essential realization is that change is possible, and that you can achieve this in your own way; in hope lies the fountainhead of the waters of potential and transformation. Such improvements can benefit your intimate relationships too, as well as enhance your self-image, confidence and decision-making abilities. Generally you are emotionally vulnerable, possibly exploited or abused by others, deceived or manipulated in various ways; but if these tendencies exist, they are reflections of those dominating patterns within you.

The choice is yours to reshape your lifestyle patterns into a way that is more suitable and open to development. Self-expression and creativity may feel restricted, although this is often dependent on your confidence in your abilities and self-image, rather than on any lack of talents and qualities. Being able to perceive yourself in a positive light may become a key to your success, because that would also alter your relationships with others. There may be an emotional reserve and lack of warmth in your social contacts, so that you feel uncomfortable in bridging social divides and entering deeper relationships. Co-operation may need further development, and that air of formality and strictness may have to be relaxed so that friendships or partnerships can be more easily formed. The need for relaxation is present in both your outer and inner relationships. You may be unable to see your nature and direction clearly and this creates an insecurity which destabilizes your self-esteem. Personal tightness and control may need to be relinquished, and greater self-relaxation would be highly beneficial, especially in changing certain attitudes and increasing your physical vitality which periodically can become low as the energy is diverted towards restraints.

Even if the majority hold a certain opinion or belief, then that alone can require you to reject it and to oppose its validity. From a more inclusive perspective there can be some truth in such a standpoint, as the majority viewpoint is often that of ''the lowest common denominator'' and can reflect the most separative beliefs and opinions. You can be undisciplined, hating those predictable routines of life and work, often finding it hard to act responsibly and with full commitment. You react against conforming to social rules, feeling that they constrain your freedom, and you often follow your choices, irrespective of the repercussions and costs of doing so.

Generally speaking, you should have a very good experience with these people, and they will give you a great deal of self-confidence so that you can stand up for yourself. Eventually you will be able to make independent decisions and govern your own life as well as the lives of others. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:50:31'),

You are likely to feel self-confident and optimistic about fulfilling your potential, aims and ambitions, and you may discover that doors open for you at the right times, or people offer support and help which enable you to move forward; luck may be a factor in your life. Your early life experiences, parental relationships and childhood social conditioning are likely to have been generally favourable, and little negativity has made any deleterious mark on your development.In your adult life, you will try to maintain good family relationships, both with your parents and with any family that you are responsible for creating. You tend to relate well with young children, who enjoy your sincere concern, care, understanding and attention. You ensure that you learnfrom all experiences so that lessons do not need to be painfully repeated. One area where extra prompting may be needed is in application. As your basic temperament is relaxed and laid-back, generating sufficient momentum towards achieving aims can sometimes seem to be too much hard work to bother. You may be unwilling to stretch and really challenge yourself to develop, and thus may fail to realise the depth of latent potential that you actually possess. In fact, you should have considerable natural talents waiting to be exploited, and you should become alert to any opportunities that offer the prospect of growth and unfoldment, so that your creative drives and ability to unite feelings and will are successfully released in your environment. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:50:38'),

Potential is present, but there may be question marks against your incentive, motivation and application in exploiting latent talents. This is the hurdle that can face you, especially when confronted with the nature of choice and decision over your life-direction. You may be multi-talented in a variety of artistic and creative ways - music, art, literature, dance, drama - yet find it hard to be focused and sufficiently disciplined to become a master and not a jack of all trades. Associated with a perceptive mind, which is capable of good assimilation and understanding, should be an intuitive quality too, which you can use as a source of insight and knowledge. This intuitive or psychic faculty will mainly operate through the emotional nature as empathic identification, in distinction to the Uranian intuition which is more mental and impersonal in nature. This intuition often gives you insights into the nature and motivation of others around you, and environmental atmospheres can influences your state of mind and well-being. There can be ambivalence towards social involvement and responsibility. Much depends on the nature of your expression; if it is within creative and artistic spheres, then your focus of attention and energy is absorbed within the creative vision. You are not unresponsive to social concerns, but you feel that being a creative channel is your contribution to society. Or you may respond to the Neptunian vibration by opening your heart wider, feeling a channel for ''universal love'' supporting and uplifting others. This path is one of service to the community of human beings, and medicine can be a favorite expression, or similar forms of physical, emotional and mental therapy and healing. In relationships, emotional freedom and trust are highly valued as components of an ideal romantic love. You tend to be emotionally faithful, and give priority to the virtues of a close and loving family environment. Your empathic and sympathetic nature adds to those feelings of closeness with family and friends. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:50:45'),

There will be less influence by the undermining quality of the Pluto energy, provided that you utilize your natural gifts in socially acceptable ways. You are able to make maximum use of innate resources, turning them to your advantage to achieve your goals. You will display a social awareness, and will feel attracted to applying your talents towards improving the social environment. Your ability to have a natural insight into resolving problems in the most effective manner can lead to a possible career or vocation in challenging problem-solving areas. You will have certain financial skills and a logical and deductive mind, preferring to tackle projects where you can reclaim order from chaos. This gives a sense of satisfaction, as you dislike chaos and a lack of structure; you want to be in control and create an ordered harmony in your life and environment. You have the potential to be a spokesperson or leader, where your vitality gives the impression of purposeful direction, and your optimistic and inspiring creative expression can attract support. This occurs naturally, without the usual Pluto desires for power and manipulative influencing of others; indeed, you have little compulsive desire to be an authoritative leader. There can be an intuitive ability which offers you clear insights into situations, possibly even a degree of clairvoyance, which any exploration into yoga, meditation and ways of self-discovery could release and amplify. There may be a healing energy from you, possibly aiding others who can absorb excessive energy releases from you on an unconscious level, and you can be a reliable support to anyone who requires aid in resolving problems. You may benefit from what appears to be ''luck'' in your life; this can come from inheritances, or by the ill fortune of others. You have considerable creative potential, but to release this fully you may have to experience some inner transformation which dissolves any blocks which are initially frustrating your success. This involves learning how to use this aspect to full advantage. Assuming that you are able to channel this energy towards socially beneficent results, and ensuring that you do not try to evade facing and resolving any important personal problems that arise - within yourself or within a relationship - then you should experience few of the traditional difficulties associated with an unintegrated Pluto energy; which, for many people, could be considered a blessing. Certainly, Pluto, can be very co-operative with your solar aims, although much of this support may lie deeper in your unconscious mind and may not always be recognized. At least unresolved Plutonic patterns will not be subtly influencing and distorting your choices and experiences in an attempt to come to your attention. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:50:59'),

The positive qualities and abilities of Sun-Saturn contacts are present; responsibility, self-discipline, practicality, patience, organization, reliability, concentration, determination, persistence and honesty. These can all be used to further your ambitions, although you may need to be wary of innate Saturn tendencies towards caution which may prevent you taking advantage of all opportunities. Determining your solar purpose and tapping into that power will be most important in applying these energies and qualities, and gaining insight into your life direction may be a necessary first step to achieve before this trine can be used positively. As you can move through life smoothly without facing obstructive challenges, you may not always feel the need to draw upon your full potential. You are attracted towards having a ''comfortable life'', and with your self-confidence and creativity expect that this will naturally come to pass. You should be able to use personal qualities and resources effectively, especially to produce an intended practical result, and you probably have a sense of appropriate timing which ensures that your actions are successful. This can be used in a variety of employments and careers, especially management, law, politics, conservation, financial services and organizational posts. You will enjoy assuming any positions of responsibility, but you may experience inner resistances in any environment that is undergoing rapid change due to social or technological progress, as this can clash with your innate conservatism and preference for the familiar. Your lifestyle is likely to reflect mainstream social attitudes, and you will try to develop it in a moderate and balanced manner, looking to create solid foundations and financial security. You prefer life to feel stable and almost predictable, and will take each step onwards with a patient attitude, usually rejecting any chances that may lead to speedier progress yet which also may lead to failure. A personal philosophy and value system will be established, and once you feel comfortable with your unique worldview you may evade situations which offer valid alternatives to your chosen perspective. In this context, the Saturninan rigidity may act as a limitation, but as your conformity is grounded within established social values, this should not work against you in achieving your ambitions. Choosing a right partner is important, as he / she needs to be similar in nature to yourself, either wholeheartedly supporting your airs, or alternatively pursuing his / her own ambitions. Career and social involvement is the probable sphere of mutual endeavour, and personal honesty and integrity are qualities that are expected, as is stability and responsibility in your partnership. Balance and moderation are two keynotes that will apply across your whole nature and lifestyle, and this will be reflected in your good health and sense of well-being. Feeling respected and loved by others, and acknowledging your own talents, will amplify your self-worth so that you can move confidently onwards on your solar path. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:51:07'),

Such periods may also stimulate a heightened awareness of your solar path and purpose, and should be carefully noted so that you can hold your mind in a meditative and receptive mode of operation, in order for insights and promptings to be consciously registered and then acted upon. You should find it relatively easy to exploit your creativity, as this aspect releases a large quantity of potentially productive ideas into those areas of life for which you require inspiration. Study the house positions and signs of both Sun and Uranus for areas that may be specifically influenced by this trine. Aided by perseverance and the application of a focused will, you should have no real obstacles confronting your efforts to manifest creative idea.These can take a myriad of forms, from experimentations aimed at developing new projects, to more adequate modifications of existing products. There is likely to be an inner detachment to your searches and creativity, a perpetual quest of enquiry and fascination, with a form of creativity which works through the creator, and is never perceived in any egotistical perspective. Your reformist, idealistic and humanitarian tendencies can find success through communication and sharing with others, and this can be important to your sense of well-being, as you do need to feel that you are of some use to others.\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:51:14');
