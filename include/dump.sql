golden age''), and in the desire for a personal life lived in a controlled, predictable manner and in a stable environment. The personal identity will be focused within strictly defined parameters, with self-imposed limitations on freedom of choice and action, wrapped around with concepts of allowable thoughts, emotions and physical acts. Much of this is a protective guard against the actual insecurity of life, and emerges from a personality that is afraid to relax fully and which is inwardly insecure. Difficulties may arise in life when you are attempting to solve problems by applying existing attitudes which then fail to work. You often find the need for change deeply disturbing, and have an intuitive fear that if you allow that process to occur, then your life would fall apart. When you have to make decisions regarding new situations, you can find it hard to make a final choice, unless you discover a way to do so which reinforces your existing attitudes and preferences; if it involves a new direction, then you become uneasy, trying to find a way to retreat back towards your old familiar patterns. In those attempts to impose control on life, you can be too dictatorial or authoritarian in your relations with others, perhaps through an insistence upon your point of view being right, or in having everything done in an established manner without deviation. Your life can become highly patterned, locking you into a circumscribed experience of life. This can define your identity for you, offering a way for you to evade those feelings of insecurity and lack of real confidence; but this will restrict you taking advantage of many opportunities in life. Often, you seek social status or approval in order to gain a reflected sense of self-worth. Denying the Uranian vibration of change can lead to problems of life adaptation and inner tensions, especially as there will be an underlying struggle between an affinity with traditional patterns and an attraction and fear of something new being released into your life. Saturn will embody the more inflexible end of the square; and if you begin to respond to Uranus (or a transit stimulates its activity), then these inhibiting patterns will begin to be eroded and destroyed. Part of you - a repressed aspect - would secretly love to break free of all binding ties, to become unconventional and liberated; if the pressures rise too strongly, then attempts to throw off self-imposed shackles may be made, just to release the tensions. Marriages and careers can be destroyed through such activity, with the end result being a collapse of existing patterns with no real comprehension of how to build a more suitable lifestyle, and just a feeling of an inner void and loss of direction being common. Ongoing transformation is the wisest course of action, as the transitions move more smoothly and the person is capable of slowly adjusting to new ways in a more harmonious manner, integrating the arising new tendencies more successfully and easily. Even within these Saturnine confines, the Uranian undercurrent is at work. The operation of your mind - where you focus yourself in order to control life - is more inconsistent and contradictory than you believe. Others probably notice this; but you will oppose any attempts to point this out to you, in your belief in your logic and rationality. Yet in the background of your mind lurk those more eccentric ideas, thoughts, desires and emotions that you rarely acknowledge. Sometimes, the strains of living with denied aspects can make you touchy in relationships, where people have to treat you in certain ways so as to avoid ''triggering those buttons'' which stimulate areas in you that you choose not to explore. For real health, these need to rise into the light, so that the pressures and energies can be released, and that you can integrate parts of your being. If you choose not to, it is likely that at some point in life, Uranus will erupt with a vengeance, and sweep away all those pretences, patterns and controlled lifestyle, forcing you to confront your denied selves and to change. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:11:42'),

Underlying this is still the idealism of these planets, but with possibly insufficient personal faith in their actual manifestation, together with an ambiguity about their own personal role and responsibility in society. There can be a tendency to follow personal goals irrespective of social needs and obligations, and a preference for personal gain and ambitions. Yet this too can be a source of personal development, and it is still perhaps too early yet to be sure how such individuals will use any social power and influence that they may have acquired. As the trine is a reconciling factor, this generation could be seen as a ''bridging group'' where both the past and future tendencies co-exist, probably uncomfortably at times. They have grown up in a rapidly changing world, though childhood conditioning would still reflect pre-war attitudes; they are thus able to serve as mediators in society, knowing the older world and yet attuned enough to the dawning of the new world. There should be sufficient intellectual capacity for them to evaluate the implications of ideological belief structures for themselves, without the imposition of authority; this should result in the development of genuinely held personal views irrespective of their nature and content. If they don''t feel convinced, after careful consideration of the validity of an idea or belief, they will usually be unable to give whole-hearted support for it - unless they compromise themselves for personal gain.

In many ways, this generation is faced with a need to resolve certain inner conflicts and opposite world views, almost as a ''trial run'' for the way in which society can achieve this on a larger scale.

The acknowledgement of the necessity of this is displayed in the economic instability and collapse in America and Germany, the British Depression, and the initial creation of the new Communist r?gime in Russia. In addition, new political approaches emerged as Fascism, National Socialism, Communism, all founded on ''new'' ideals and ideologies, and yet all often demonstrating an outlook liable to cause international conflict, despite their domestic social improvements benefiting their own people. Change was in the air; many were responding to its heady effect, trying to take advantage of the energies recently released to them; and there is a feeling of a searching and experimentation during a time of crisis and transition, when little seemed clear and definite, and most seemed part of an international melting-pot, the results of which could define the direction of the future. There was an acceptance of breaking free of the past, becoming open to all new ideas and developments; some welcomed this with excitement, as cultural and social structures began to dissolve or lose their predominant places; some found the changes disturbing, feeling the sands beneath their feet changing too rapidly to feel secure. Those under the trine''s influence felt that the tide of history was moving with them, and that no obstacle could stand in their way for long.

The conjunction is quite rare, being made the last time around 1848, a time of social revolution in Europe and a time of great civil unrest and social change in Europe and America, and occurring again in the period of 1963-68. The influence of these potent transpersonal planets is likely to be radical and far-reaching, setting a trend for the following century to develop and integrate, one which requires a long period of time for society to assimilate. In that sense, the influence is world-wide, and the period in which the close conjunction is made should be carefully analyzed to perceive the essential thrust of this directive energy and the emergent trends for social development over the next hundred years. With the cosmic periodic releasing of such powerful energies, the human reaction to them is varied and often polarized in response. These reveal the interface between the individual life and the collective life of a society. It is as though from a multiplicity of sources a new alluring voice is rising, which is revealing a new approach to life for society to absorb. Certain individuals respond enthusiastically to this new siren call, embracing ''the new way'', and begin to group together as an influential minority within their own society. They then reflect the new ideas, impregnate society with them and act as transmitters of change. Broader social reaction to ''the new way'' is often slow, apart from the inevitable reaction against the new trend; and often society attempts to use the power of its established structures to resist what appears to be a threatening impulse. The influence of the conjunction is to initiate a new phase of social change; and during the 1963-68 aspect, it is that of a revolutionary new spirit in the air, extolling the virtues of individual rights and freedom, stimulating the need for the transformation of the existing social establishment and the breakdown of outdated and limiting social and national attitudes and engrained patterns of thinking. For those who were (and still are) attuned and receptive to this visionary energy, there is a personal feeling of involvement in a vast process of evolutionary development occurring on earth, a feeling that their individual life is intimately linked with a vast plan slowly unfolding into manifestation, and that their lives are guided by some greater consciousness, participants in a planetary drama. AS a world-wide group held together by shared response, they collectively form a conduit for the new social approach to be mediated into human life and consciousness. Some reflect this in a more conscious manner, by seeking to manifest the overshadowing energy via deliberate meditation or occult rituals, etc.. What is of importance to this group is the respect and value of life in all of its forms, ranging from human life to animals, plants, all of the many appearances of Nature, and the abundant creativity of Earth. Life is viewed as essentially ''holy'', to be cherished, respected, enjoyed and protected. It is a basic attitude to life that wants the highest quality of life for everyone, founded upon a balanced and careful relationship with the environment and the natural world, whereby human society moves from being a dangerous exploiter of nature''s gifts to living in a more natural harmony. Individually, there is the need to develop as a unique person, free to live and express oneself within a peaceful, co-operative co-existence, to learn how to unfold innate potentiality without it infringing on the rights of others. Some twenty years after the close conjunction, the attitudes released into the world at this time were still serving as a necessary social direction; and many pressure groups had been formed to further the progress of such causes.

If actually applied in the world, the tendencies which are associated with the sextile would help bring about social improvement and clarity within government and publicly representative bodies. It invokes a natural voice of the people to object against social injustice and hypocrisy, to resist dictatorial abuses of power and influence emanating from central government, and to expose corruption whenever it occurs in high places. It embodies the dichotomy between the individual and the State, wherein the State should reflect the democratic will of the people, and be the elected servant of the people, and yet in real life becomes an independent entity dominated by power-blocs and influential political parties which perceives itself to be superior to the people and often ignores their demands. The political ?lite is often quite dismissive of the general public, believing that it has the machinery and power to manipulate the social consciousness as it wills, and invariably wishes that what often passes as democracy did not exist to get in its way. Unfortunately, the analysis of public apathy and the ?lite''s ability to manipulate social attitudes is often correct, and serves as a reactionary barrier to social progress.

This was the second phase of post-war children, born into a time of relative stability and reconstruction, when the memories of the war were ebbing away into past history, even though the Korean War was rekindling some of them. This group received a psychic impression from the collective, which embodies a form of social confusion then prevalent which was reflective of the collective mind. Social direction was the issue. The defeat of Churchill''s government after the ending of the war, a government which seemed to represent the past, and the introduction of the post-war Labor reformist policies such as the Welfare State seemed to herald a new vision and direction. But the collective was torn between dreams and fears of a new world, and a rejection of painful memories of man''s inhumanity; a clash between the future and the past, the unknown and the known. Reflecting this collective conflict, the individuals born at the time received a pattern of rebellion (Uranus) which was mixed with confusion (Neptune) over what to do, which direction to travel in, how to achieve objectives, even what these objectives actually were. The only model that could be absorbed was that of their parents and peers, which offered conflicting and confusing social messages. The problem in later life would become ambivalence; they would be torn between a need to revolt against authority and the establishment, and a need to feel socially secure. Purity of ideals would become a challenge, especially when confronted with the pragmatic demands of economic and family life. With this aspect there is an aversion to leaders, who, it is felt, lead people into blind obedience and conformity, which to the Uranian spirit is anathema and opposed to the Uranian principle of freedom. Personal freedoms are paramount, and their repression may lead to a struggle to assert them. Yet this group eventually fragmented into various types. Some were reluctant revolutionaries, eventually being reabsorbed into the social ''mainstream''; some were ''rebels without a cause'', social misfits with no direction except that of aggressive reaction. Members of this aspect group were attracted to the existing hippie and drug counter-culture, in the later phase after 1968; others became early leaders of the mid-seventies'' punk movement, an anarchic reactionary youth revolt against conformity; and perhaps most significant of all became part of the spreading of the New Age movement which incorporates the ecological Green political groups. In fact, many of those who were early adherents of the hippie ideals have become part of the New Age culture, which is expanding throughout society through alternative health therapies, mind training, healthy foods, and an ideology of individual and collective wholeness. It is in this way that the core group of those born during the period 1952-6 is active in taking control of their own lives and influencing society. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:19:32'),

The close square applied from 1931 to 1934; and the phase was of rapid metamorphosis in crucial countries like Germany and Italy. These were two clear examples of the impact of the Uranian-Plutonian energy, where nationalistic tendencies and ?litist attitudes were elevated into a sense of social direction, manipulated by dictatorial groupings in an attempt both to seize power and to benefit the State by introducing new political concepts. The power complex and need to dominate of the unregenerated Pluto energy is displayed in the need to expand their control and influence into other less powerful nations, through ruthlessly expressed violence and force. The general world economic instability helped to create the space for radical and revolutionary political agitators to gain power, feeding off the exploited energy of will (Pluto) to build an apparently attractive edifice of the new society. In many cases, this basic urge to create new social structures was genuinely held by those whose motives and ideals were socially beneficial; however, they were to lose their positions of responsibility to those whose intentions were more mixed, and who were being swept along by their receptiveness to the powerful energies pouring into the world, which served to over-stimulate aspects of their unintegrated personalities. The collective group responding to the Fascist and Nazi ideals was generating and reflecting the possessing energy, especially through the group mind and seen in those emotionally manipulated and invocative mass public rallies, which were similar in effect to certain types of magical ritual. There were two main ways in which people reacted to the social change occurring. One was to collaborate with it, being excited and thrilled by active participation in a national resurrection, irrespective of some of its hidden darker aspects. The other way was to be apathetic and passive, allowing it to go on all around hem, feeling insecure and unable to have any influence even if they disagreed with he dominating group. What became paramount in this square was the stimulation of the unconscious national mind and emotions by Pluto, which overrode the more intellectually idealistic mind quality of Uranus. All those repressed tendencies rose into physical view, those attitudes of superiority, of national frustration, of harsh, sadistic dismissal of other ''inferior'' races, and of the power of violent aggression, became integrated into the expression of the new society; and freedom was ignored by the might of the oppressor. The dark face of incorrectly applied Pluto energy was ready to be unleashed onto the world. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:19:57'),

This tends to condition their perception of life and people, which in effect can sometimes veer towards pessimism and cynicism, especially if they were born in the early years of the trine when the world war was at its height and the result still hung in the balance. Underlying this is still the idealism of these planets, but with possibly insufficient personal faith in their actual manifestation, together with an ambiguity about their own personal role and responsibility in society. There can be a tendency to follow personal goals irrespective of social needs and obligations, and a preference for personal gain and ambitions. Yet this too can be a source of personal development, and it is still perhaps too early yet to be sure how such individuals will use any social power and influence that they may have acquired. As the trine is a reconciling factor, this generation could be seen as a ''bridging group'' where both the past and future tendencies co-exist, probably uncomfortably at times. They have grown up in a rapidly changing world, though childhood conditioning would still reflect pre-war attitudes; they are thus able to serve as mediators in society, knowing the older world and yet attuned enough to the dawning of the new world. There should be sufficient intellectual capacity for them to evaluate the implications of ideological belief structures for themselves, without the imposition of authority; this should result in the development of genuinely held personal views irrespective of their nature and content. If they don''t feel convinced, after careful consideration of the validity of an idea or belief, they will usually be unable to give whole-hearted support for it - unless they compromise themselves for personal gain. They are aware of the dangers of gullibility and a lack of public discrimination regarding leaders - as the German people in World War II demonstrated - yet are not fully convinced by the intent of any leaders who use truth as an expedient to be employed only when it suits them. In many ways, this generation is faced with a need to resolve certain inner conflicts and opposite world views, almost as a ''trial run'' for the way in which society can achieve this on a larger scale. There are paradoxes on both mental and emotional levels that should be resolved and integrated, because too often such people are caught in the cleft stick of their own indecision and confusion over which ''face'' to present - the face of the older ways, or the face reflecting the emerging changes in the world. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:20:37'),

(2168, 0, 'us', 'uranus-trine-pluto', 7, 'The trine aspect occurred during the 1920s, and stimulated an impulse of international change, the urge to reform existing social and political structures. The acknowledgement of the necessity of this is displayed in the economic instability and collapse in America and Germany, the British Depression, and the initial creation of the new Communist r?gime in Russia. In addition, new political approaches emerged as Fascism, National Socialism, Communism, all founded on ''new'' ideals and ideologies, and yet all often demonstrating an outlook liable to cause international conflict, despite their domestic social improvements benefiting their own people. Change was in the air; many were responding to its heady effect, trying to take advantage of the energies recently released to them; and there is a feeling of a searching and experimentation during a time of crisis and transition, when little seemed clear and definite, and most seemed part of an international melting-pot, the results of which could define the direction of the future. There was an acceptance of breaking free of the past, becoming open to all new ideas and developments; some welcomed this with excitement, as cultural and social structures began to dissolve or lose their predominant places; some found the changes disturbing, feeling the sands beneath their feet changing too rapidly to feel secure. Those under the trine''s influence felt that the tide of history was moving with them, and that no obstacle could stand in their way for long. The traditional ways were considered outdated and restrictive; and they were looking for something new in which they could discover some form of personal meaning; and they flocked to support the new emergent political philosophies with emotional enthusiasm, as they appeared to embody the new world that they felt was imminent. The Uranus-Pluto trine acted as a channel for energies to stimulate national characteristics, and to dissolve the power of tradition and the past. It had a jarring effect on the world, initially received as what can now be perceived as a destructive and deluding force, yet one which was necessary to clear the ground for the more constructive influence to emerge. It gave a boost to scientific and intellectual development in the West, yet stimulated a relatively immature emotional level in society, which found early security by becoming part of mass emotional support for those charismatic demagogues that rose to the forefront of the political arena. In some ways, the effects of the trine are the direct opposite to those of the previous opposition aspect at the turn of the century, 1900-1903, almost as if the ''turning of the screw'' creates even more social confusion and conflict within the period of the World Wars.

But even then, due to openness to new opportunities and directions, you''ll succeed in discovering new roads to travel. You may need to make more efficient use of your personal talents and resources, perhaps through greater self-discipline and focusing on your intentions. Forethought and planning may be skills which require additional development, and which can help to maximize future success. You will want to use your full potential, and searching for ways to do this may make you restless and unable to settle for very long. It is the expansionary quality of Jupiter that causes this agitation, and by recognizing this activity you should ensure that routine work or lifestyles do not restrict or trap you, or else its intended positive contribution to your life could initially result in more disruptive effects. Areas that may attract your interest include education, medicine, law, travel, philosophy, religion, social and humanitarian influence. You look for progress and scope for expansion wherever you become involved, especially when your contribution can be beneficial for others'' welfare. There is the potential of merging your talents and interests with areas of social concern, so that your energy flows into the resolution of social issues, or you may become a spokesperson or representative of group ideals and social aims. Work involving the initial impulse for transformative social projects may particularly suit you, and offer ample scope for ongoing development. Linking your path with social needs could be an appropriate action and wise choice. You enjoy expressing personal creativity and imagination, feeling that energy flowing into new forms and channels, sparking off new thoughts, directions and perceptions. Discovering a path which evokes self-motivation is very important, enabling that enthusiastic energy to be released. You like to be well-informed, and will be aware of most current social trends and world news. Ongoing learning is especially enjoyed, as it provides a source for the renewal of interest in life and opens up new areas of fascination and experience. It is a fullness of life that you seek, a real enjoyment of yourself and the world, and this can lead you to be attracted towards more hedonistic explorations. Yet underlying this is a need to create your own unique perception, philosophy and worldview, which is a reflection of a spiritual need to discover your own meaning and purpose of life. Your spiritual interests do not really fit within orthodox teachings and religious organizations, and mainly derive from the sense of inner guidance and trust in the beneficence of life. You will adopt a position of tolerance and freedom, especially valuing the unity of all life and the concept of universal human fellowship, so civil-rights issues may interest you, or ecological concerns. In relationships, you prefer partners who are fundamentally in tune with your perception of life, fellow enthusiasts and positive thinkers who appreciate the subtler qualities of people and experiences, rather than being preoccupied with materialistic matters and the accumulation of money and social power. You will expect much from a partner, and can inadvertently place pressures on others to satisfy your needs, rather than being equally aware of their own feelings and desires. More awareness may be needed in intimate relationships. For example you may need to curb your tendency to over-indulge in pleasurable activities. Otherwise you may create imbalances in yourself that need adjustment through greater health care. Containing that restless spirit may also be necessary at times, and you may need to realize that if you always focus on the horizon then you can lose sig\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:41:42'),

The application and exploitation of your powerful will becomes a major impulse that demands expression, often resulting in a more self-centered level of preoccupation, focused on satisfying your desires and ambitions. You may have an aggressive, combative temperament, which can respond quickly to any hint of a threat or potentially competitive situations, seeing these as an opportunity to display your force and innate abilities and talents. You will feel a need to prove yourself to the world through achieving, or at least rise to a higher social profile than the majority. You may tend to assume attitudes of superiority, which is often derived from a sense of self-confidence, and inwardly you hold a self0image as a leader in some capacity. An urge to battle lies near the surface of your personality, and you can approach life as if it is a challenge, almost provoking encounters by ''throwing down the gauntlet'' as a testing of your strength and power. To some, you may seem overly assertive, and your presence may threaten them by its forceful vibration. You may acquire several adversaries in the course of your journey through life, especially as you are liable to be insensitive to others'' feelings. This may occur particularly within your employment or business life, where you are likely to contact other powerful individuals. You intensely enjoy applying your will-power, and may need to pay extra attention to your relationship manner and style of expression, as this could become a source of contention and downfall if it is misapplied. A liability to anger quickly may need some control too, or words spoken in haste may ruin relationships or friendships. You react against limitations and restrictions, and find adherence to the status quo or repetitive routines anathema to your volatile spirit. You love action, and the adrenaline rush of physical or dangerous sports and activities is highly appealing. Your enthusiasms can be spontaneous and impulsive, and you prefer to leave space in your lifestyle for sudden decisions and changes of direction which can renew vitality and add a touch of freshness when life becomes jaded and familiar. You may be attracted to share this love of life and excess energy with others, stimulating them to break free of their self-imposed ruts and shake off their apathy. Some may not appreciate your endeavors though, and you may need to recognize when your efforts will fall on stony ground. There is an opinionated streak in your character that can take offence if anyone challenges your attitudes, values, thoughts or beliefs, and you take this as a personal attack, rather than a sharing of differing points of view. You can adopt an attitude of ''I''m right, and you''re wrong'' in such encounters, and refuse to consider alternative perceptions; this can be a restriction of your openness to life''s many wonders and infinite variety of perceptions. In relationships, you do not easily compromise, as you tend to be self-centered and concerned about reaching for your desires; this could become a problem unless it is carefully modified, or you have an extremely passive and supportive partner. A strong sexual drive and inflamed passions are likely factors in your relationships, and you may be especially attracted to sudden love affairs, particularly if that theme of ''conquest'' is paramount in your nature. While you are likely to possess considerable creative abilities, you may have difficulties in focusing these constructively and consistently, and despite your high level of activity you may waste energy that could be more positively applied. Part of this is due to an impulsiveness that prefers action to forethought and planning, and this tendency may need tempering by better managements of your resources and less haste in charging towards your objectives. Listen to the advice of others, or take professional suggestions; you may not always know best. Your focus is power through action, and the main areas that this can be released through are the conjunction house, and the houses ruled by both Sun and Mars in your chart.

(2203, 0, 'us', 'sun-conjunct-neptune', 7, 'Any Neptune aspect to the Sun is likely to have a distinct impact on the individual expression of personal power, identity and life direction, so it becomes important to create a positive approach to the Neptunian energy and especially so with the more influential aspects of the conjunction, square and opposition. The difficulty with an unintegrated or repressed Neptune is that its influence often appears to be negative, and with the conjunction aspect it is imperative to discover a way of joining this energy to the natural form of expression that the Sun sign indicates. You will probably experience an ongoing challenge of self-confidence and of establishing a suitable and satisfying lifestyle and sense of purpose. The nebulous influence of Neptune''s sea mists tends to confuse you, dissolving many of your intentions away, and making your sense of individual identity almost transparent at times as that personality centre seems to ebb and flow in tune with an inner tidal rhythm. Because of an inner experience associated with insubstantiality, you can lack the strength of a firm and fixed individuality, and this has the effect of diminishing confidence regarding your actual capabilities and will to achieve any objectives. You can find it hard to be consistent and to persevere through self-discipline and application for long periods of time. Your identity can appear to be periodically submerged by the powerful Neptune energy, dissolving plans and ambitions, and then leaving you washed ashore in another inner place wondering what to do next even before you have completed the last project. That ethereal Neptunian music will invade your conscious mind, acting as a diverting distraction, and in some cases can influence the listener to becomes lost in the swirlings of his / her own hyperactive imagination, leading to self-delusions. Confronting the stark realities of life is not always easy with a prominent Neptune. There is a tendency to build a private reality, one which excludes the dark sides of self and the world, establishing a veiled and limiting perspective of life which only generates activity by additional repression into the unconscious mind. Personal responsibility is avoided if possible, and all experiences are filtered through this restrictive veil, a state that if prolonged leads to inner and outer alienation. Often these forms of self-delusion emanate from personal desires, emotions and sensitive feelings, as Neptune is associated with the plastic and pliable astral level. You may develop unusual needs and desires which are subtle, intangible yet peculiarly persistent, and you may feel inwardly driven to experience or actualize them in some way. For many, such hard-to-define feelings and yearnings create more confusion and self-deception, especially when attached to idealistic images of perfection and unrealistic expectations which can only bring disillusionment and disappointment in their wake. For the few, Neptune may bring genuine inspiration, although, even in such cases, this may become mixed with desires of self-elevation and ambitions, especially in the sphere of the conjunction''s house. One of the hardest lessons for anyone with a close Neptune aspect is facing the realities of life. Neptune finds such confrontations almost inimical to its sensitivities, preferring to slide away instead of looking.

You can probably adopt a fairly hard-line philosophy, having the opinion that people can change their lives and be self-sufficient if they want to, instead of being weak and relying upon others, although you tend to resist change yourself.

Ambition is likely to be a powerful motivating force within your personality, and, once your aims have been clarified, careful planning and application can help you to achieve them. Persistence and hard work may be the keys to later success, and it is unlikely that progress will be swift or aims realized at an early age. As Saturn implies limitations and barriers, it is probable that even when following your solar path there will be obstacles and frustrations confronting you, and there may be periods when you begin to feel the inhibitions of your nature and path acutely. You can lack sufficient confidence, adopting a self-deprecating attitude as justifying any lack of progress. Temperamentally, you are serious and reserved, often taciturn in expression, controlled and disciplined and viewing life with an uneasy attitude. To you, life demands effort and application, and nothing comes easy or free. So you believe that to become materially comfortable you may have to deny certain feelings or needs in order to concentrate and focus on your aims. Unfortunately, through self-denial and austere attitudes, you may repress self-expression, creating inner imbalances which have later negative side-effects. These could become more predominant if you enter a phase of frustrations, where disappointments generate tensions, stresses, angry thoughts and emotional attitudes. Disorders of the digestive system may be associated with this, and you may need to increase relaxation in your life, perhaps by consciously dismantling any fixity of lifestyle and daily habit patterns that may be unconsciously erected around yourself as a form of protective barrier. The house position of the conjunction is a sphere of opportunity and of limitation for you, depending on the inner changes that you can consciously make. Success can result from applying your strengths, which are likely to be in areas of organization, self-reliance, discipline, persistence and determined application. The theme of consolidation and building is associated with this aspect, where existing resources are used in ways which take greater advantage of their potential, expanding from a secure foundation but not overly risky or speculative. Careers in management, politics, law, scientific research, teaching, local government may be attractive, especially if you are able to use an ability to assume responsibility within your employment. Your earlier childhood development will have been influenced by the relationship to your father. Look at the attitudes towards life that your parents expressed, and see if these have become your dominating attitudes and values too. You may have received a highly ordered and strict parental discipline, encouraging conformity to parental desires and codes of conduct; moralistic or religious attitudes may have conditioned your worldview. There may have been a lack of parental approval or response to your unique childhood nature, perhaps a lack of emotional affinity (perceived or actual) which made you feel more isolated and independent; certainly you would have experienced an early inner maturation process. Have you become what your parents wanted you to be? And is this in accordance with your desires and dreams? You may need to break free from these earlier psychological programs that are still operating in you, so that you can move in new directions or transcend those restrictions in life that are acting as barriers to fulfillment and success. You have much of value to share with the world, but this may need greater releasing. For instance, you may feel that everyone makes their own destiny (and certainly, to some degree this is correct), but this should not stop you being generous if you have financial abundance in your life; you could help others to help themselves. There may be a belief that there is a lesson or message within every life experience, but this should never stop feelings of love and friendliness flowing out naturally from you to others. Acknowledging others in a different way may be necessary, so that you are more aware of their needs and qualities, and this can divert you from your self-preoccupations. Certainly you will require a compatible intimate partner who recognizes your need for achievement, and who is willing to support your endeavors; but equally, you should not forget that your partner also has their own life path to follow, and you should not forget their needs either.

Where this does happen, it is usually repeating a situation that has been created in their other partnerships, whether personal relationships or working partnerships. All too easily, the Sun-Descendant person can believe that his / her life is fated and that he / she is merely a pawn in the hands of the heavens or of others'' superior power. This is not always the case, of course, but certainly Sun-Descendant, rather like a Sun Libran, does like to share the decision-making process and does like someone to do things with. Relationship and partnership are very important to this type. It''s a good placement for people who work in a partnership, and indeed for anyone who works in a one-to-one situation. In some cases, the Sun-Descendant might say ''I am nothing without a partner; life has no meaning without another person''. More positively, Sun-Descendant people might say ''I find myself through close interaction with another person''. This is a very good placement for analysts, therapists and the like. They can find their identity through close interaction with another person, and, similarly, in a one-to-one situation they can enable others to shed light on themselves. They may even achieve personal distinction and recognition through relationship. It''s a common placement in the charts of lawyers too; they often work in partnerships, and on each case they work in partnership with their clients; usually, also, lawyers are involved in litigation with ''open enemies'', and are working, ideally, for justice and fairness. The father of the person with Sun on the Descendant was usually viewed by the individual more as a husband to the mother than a father to the child. Sometimes this is literally true, where the father-figure in the home during the formative years is not in fact the biological father; but usually this is more the psychological experience than the actual one. Father was concerned with being a partner (in the marital or business sense) above all else. If the Sun is in the 7th house, the individual will seek through marriage a relationship with the father archetype, either by playing the role of father or by expecting the ''other'' to do it for him / her. If the Sun is in the 6th house, the individual considers working partnerships to be especially important. In any event, the individual is usually ''fathering'' others in the sense of providing some sort of identity for them. Descendant-Sun people are proud of their partnerships. This is the type who, aged 70 or 80, can be found linking arms with their spouses and stating proudly that they have been married fifty years or so. It is not that relationships are more likely to last with the Sun conjunct the Descendant, or that it is necessarily a good thing if they do, or even that the relationships will be necessarily better than any other people''s. But with this placement relationship tends to be the most important thing, and something of which to be proud. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:44:20'),

Underlying this attitude is a clashing of inner energies, which are projected out as shadow-adversaries in the external world, so that arguments, dissention and conflict almost seem to follow in your footsteps. There is little tranquility in your world; it becomes more of a battlefield where you believe you can ''win your spurs'' proving your capabilities. You are fired by the competitive spirit, intending to win and be number one, although the quality of your aggressive vibration tends to attract similar people into your life, and this can result in power struggles in working or domestic environments. Applying extra force may leave you in a position of superiority, yet can also increase the number of adversaries that you leave in your wake; your genuine friendships can be few if you act in this manner. You have a powerful desire nature, and you easily become fixated on attaining these desires, whether they are lovers, positions of executive status, or whatever, even if your energies are focused only temporarily in such specific directions. These desires can reflect the themes of the houses and signs of Mars and the Sun, and often contain the issues that you feel most combative about. There can be an aura of ''danger'' surrounding you, possibly with a sexual magnetism and aggressive power that some can find extremely attractive, although this energy can overflow through displays of irascible temper and potential violence if uncontrolled. You are very physically responsive, and will have a developed visual and sensual appreciation of life. You may have to ensure that your desires do not become compulsive or obsessive in nature. In relationships, you may lack sensitivity to others'' feelings and needs, and may need to transform expectations of a partner so that they conform more closely to a realistic appreciation, rather than providing fuel for later disillusionment. A wise choice of partner is required; otherwise your domestic life could become volatile and traumatic; a partner who evokes your higher nature and qualities is probably more ideal than one who just stimulates your passionate and vigorous nature. Finding a suitable companion, who is strong enough not to allow you to dominate, would probably help in modifying your attitude towards life. A danger can lie in a tendency to make impulsive decisions or actions, and then regret them later. It may be that experience eventually influences you to make changes in your style of expression, and this may not occur until later in life, perhaps after the age of thirty and through developing maturity. It is to be hoped that there will come a point when you lessen that driving feeling of insecurity and lack of worth, so that you can recognize your real value and potential. Once that self-imposed pressure to challenge and compete has diminished, and acknowledgement of your performance has been achieved, then new life directions may open. When this occurs take the opportunity to dismantle your combative attitudes, by broadening your world view beyond those limiting tendencies of yours to perceive life in stark black-and-white distinctions. This could develop to include involvements with social causes and pressure groups, where your partisan approach and abundant energies could be put to positive use, providing that you can maintain a balanced perspective on your beliefs and attitudes, and do not attempt a forceful proselytizing or fanatical expression. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:44:35'),

Sometimes these can take the forms of voluntary suffering arising from inner guilt patterns associated with deep-lying desires; an expiation or atonement of ''sins'', actual or imaginary. This can result in the sacrificial martyr attitude, and is often quite unnecessary, yet in a strange way provides a foundation to your life. Your relationships can be characterised by degrees of confusion and misunderstandings, and through powerful emotions you are liable to overly intimate relationships with fantasies and wishful thinking, forming a deceiving miasma which affects all involved. There can be a pattern operating through you that subverts clear, honest and direct communication, even though you may not fully accept or realise this. You often avoid commitment and entering fully into emotional involvements through fears of being trapped or dominated, which, allied to a suspicious nature, does not augur well for stable relationships. The main problem with inner glamours and illusions is that they are so difficult to identify correctly, and obviously such distorting mirrors make it hard to perceive with clarity. The real effect of spiritual transformation shatters these mirrors. Being able to recognise and acknowledge that such problems exist is the first the first and most important step, followed by consistent action to discover the appropriate remedy.

Your temperament can be assertive, aggressive and extremist, tending to use your powerful will like a sledgehammer to achieve objectives. You prefer to force situations so that you are ready to take the advantage before anyone else can, or will act through impulse without fully considering the consequences of following your desires and aims. To others, your will and personality can seem a little overbearing, provocative and dominating, especially as you always prefer to be in control of all situations, and hate to feel unsure of your ground or realize there is nothing you can do to influence circumstances in your favor. This is why you desire to be in a position of authority, calling the tune and writing the rules, yet are so rebellious when roles are reversed; you then use your influence to be subversive and manipulate others to resist authority. You will feel a desire to change the world into your image, reflecting the way that you think it should be. As virtually everyone else is attempting the same in small or large ways, inevitably you may experience conflict with others who do not agree with your panacea for the world''s ills. If you attempt to dictate to people, by forceful expression, you may easily fail to get the right kind of support and co-operation, especially if it is made clear that you intend to be the kingpin and final arbiter. The problem with dominating and forceful personalities is that usually they insist on having their own way, and are rarely, if ever, wrong. This usually ends in relationship conflict which leads to their more creative supporters quitting, leaving behind ''mere followers'' who remain with the ''leader'' in sycophantic acquiescence. Without proper awareness and understanding, these tendencies can become negatively expressed, eventually to your detriment. Yet equally they can become extremely positive qualities to be used in socially creative ways once excess self-interest is transcended, and you move towards the higher solar path of your individuality rather than just satisfying lower egoic needs and desires. You will need to undergo a period of self-regeneration, to acknowledge the needs of others to be themselves, not as mere adjuncts to your dictates, but people equally able and right to assert themselves. More harmonious and successful relationships are possible, especially when your need for self-assertion diminishes through self-understanding and confidence in your own worth. This can involve learning to be self-reliant in achieving your own aims, rather than having to manipulate others into unconsciously aiding your private intentions.

The issue of self-esteem and worth is highlighted, and you may experience a degree of hidden insecurity and fears of full involvement in life. You may feel that your success is being frustrated by the world, which appears to confront you by obstacles on your way. Much depends on your reactions to such experiences, and your inner attitudes will determine how you deal with them. At times, you can seem almost over-assertive or aggressive, and this can diminish opportunities for co-operative endeavors to develop, especially when you fail to notice your effect on others, or inadvertently ignore their feelings and sensitivities. Often this is just an overreaction to your fears in relating to people, and instead of relaxing more, you tend to project through your tightness an over dominant energy that others can find uncomfortable. Alternatively, you could retreat back into a surrendered posture of passivity to life''s challenges, defeated before you start. Certainly learning how to live with any restrictions imposed by Saturn may be a necessary form of adjustment, although this should not imply a resignation to them, but merely a conscious modification to circumstances and a consequent step to transcend them later. The choice is yours to reshape your lifestyle patterns into a way that is more suitable and open to development. Self-expression and creativity may feel restricted, although this is often dependent on your confidence in your abilities and self-image, rather than on any lack of talents and qualities. Being able to perceive yourself in a positive light may become a key to your success, because that would also alter your relationships with others. There may be an emotional reserve and lack of warmth in your social contacts, so that you feel uncomfortable in bridging social divides and entering deeper relationships. Co-operation may need further development, and that air of formality and strictness may have to be relaxed so that friendships or partnerships can be more easily formed. The need for relaxation is present in both your outer and inner relationships. You may be unable to see your nature and direction clearly and this creates an insecurity which destabilizes your self-esteem. Personal tightness and control may need to be relinquished, and greater self-relaxation would be highly beneficial, especially in changing certain attitudes and increasing your physical vitality which periodically can become low as the energy is diverted towards restraints. Becoming looser, more tolerant, accepting and understanding would act as a great liberator, or you may begin to bow under the strain of those self-imposed restrictions, especially as your enjoyment of life progressively diminishes.

Within your hidden inner life, you are likely to feel undercurrents of restless activity, which, while peaking and troughing, are an ever-present participant in your nature. This can lead to nervous tensions and irritability, and an edgy tone to your energy which is often psychically communicated or received by others and experienced as an intangible sense of unease.

You can be hypersensitive, but may tend to deny this aspect through feeling uncomfortable with your emotional nature and its ebb and flow, as this does not fit into that intellectualized self-image that you have developed. This can be quite delusory, but is also a prop for you to centre your identity around. These images can include considering yourself ''before your time'', an unrecognized genius or artist, a cultural bohemian, a radical revolutionary, an important social adversary. Glamorous images emerge from that high opinion of yourself and those peculiar insights and ideas that you attempt to communicate to others. There are likely to be some nuggets of gold scattered around, but more often than not you fail to deliver, wisps of intentions dematerializing into the air. Your evaluations are often impractical, and due to diversions towards new glamorous ideas, or to an unfocused will, you often fail to develop fully any natural gifts.

Just learning to listen seriously to other points of view and perceptions on life can teach you much, in distinction to one of your behaviour patterns which sees such contact and communication as a form of competitive challenge, mentally pitting yourself as an adversarial opponent of another point of view. You may need to stop tilting against windmills. Your heroic quest should not be externally directed, but internalized in an attempt to achieve an inner transformation. This is not to imply that the windmills are not there - they probably are - but you need an effort to redirect and redistilling your nature and energies so that your solar centre becomes more powerful and integrative. A redefinition of rebellious spirit needs to be made by you, a re-channeling of your scattered energies.

You feel the need to develop a suitable personal lifestyle in which there are opportunities for freedom, growth, and creative development, enabling you to diminish those less enjoyable aspects of life, consciously replacing them by activities that evoke your strengths and talents. Seeking wealth may not engage your wholehearted participation, but the abundance and prosperity of a suitable lifestyle will attract your creative endeavors. This could be through creating a more simplified, natural lifestyle, provided it fulfils your need for enjoyment. You may find many standard forms of employment restrictive, as they often prove to be inimical to creativity and the application of intelligence, through being repetitive and limiting the exploitation of natural talents and personal qualities. You may need to look for new employment avenues, or move into your self-directed path for real satisfaction and greater opportunities. Your communicative skills could be usefully employed, and this opens areas of education, teaching, public relations, consultancy, law, media and theatre work for possible consideration. As your focus is probably on your mental level engaged in intellectual activity, you can easily manage to study and learn, and over time this increases your inner storehouse of knowledge and information, giving you a ''well-stocked'' mind.

The themes of creativity through art, music, crafts, writing, and drama are highlighted, as are the inner paths of mysticism and psychic sensitivity as ways of co-operating with the Neptunian impulse and moving towards the solar centre. You are likely to be aware of your own creative potential, and inclined to allow this natural expression. One ability that you may possess is creating vivid mental images, which through the process of creative visualization can be used either in the building of your own future path, or by being offered for the stimulation and enjoyment of others through music, art and literature. Manifesting these evocative images into a tangible form is a very important gift, and can be applied in a variety of ways, for self-aggrandizement, for the accumulation of wealthe and power, or to benefit others. This issue of selfish versus selfless actions is one which may confront you, influencing your decisions and motivations. The art of visualization is a powerful merging of mind-will-imagination, and is the source of creation. Your sensitivity to others and world pain will be strong, connected to a reasonably well-developed awareness of social responsibility, where by empathic feelings you believe that you should and could aid in the alleviation of human suffering. Yet this psychic absorption of pain can also make you turn away from actually doing anything about this social awareness, so you may register and acknowledge its existence yet attempt to deny your role in healing. It is unlikely that you will be capable of dealing with the causes of suffering, but you may prefer to hold a soothing and healing balm to the symptoms of the pain. You hope that others who are stronger and perhaps less sensitive than yourself will deal with the negative causes in society. You may be of value by communication inspiration, perhaps through writing for publication or through the media. Linking your grasp of social responsibility with a good dramatic expression could bring aspects of society that need transforming to the attention of others; crusading journalism and TV documentaries are prime examples of such work. This is an asset that you could apply; and, if you choose to develop this, then your imagination and inspiration will be rekindled. This need to maintain relationships with people, which also involves a broader social sphere than that of just friendship, is a route through which Neptune works, leading you towards your solar purpose. With most people, you experience a laissez-faire relationship, where tolerance and empathy dominate, and interpersonal pressures are not imposed. While your sensitivity is ever-present, you are not overly demanding or tied to impossible expectations of others, although you do prefer self-confident companions whose associations force you to firm up any tendency towards Neptunian nebulousness and indecision. You have a humanitarian spirit, relating freely and easily to a wide range of human types, seeing value in all and not just in those who are ''successful'' in terms of social evaluation. There is an element of a chameleon nature about you, a malleability enabling you to fit into a variety of situations and social scenes, an inner flexibility whereby your attitudes and expression mould themselves to any specific environment and take over from deeper personal preferences. This is a Neptunian water quality in your personality, where you ''take the shape of any container''. It can be advantageous, yet equally can lead to losing your distinct identity due to repeated chameleon transformations. This may therefore need to be carefully monitored or guarded against if your personality begins to fragment and dissolve; although, if you are following a mystical path, your aim becomes dissolving into the ''ocean'', where the droplet of the separate self loses all boundaries and disappears into the universal ocean of life. \r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:47:29'),

Communication is one talent, where you should be able to transmit your thoughts to others clearly, fluently and with style. It is likely that you will work closely with groups, possibly through mutual ideologies aimed towards resolving social problems, as you feel a responsibility to add your support towards social betterment.

This joining of your solar path with the social concerns for transformation which emanate from Pluto can be potentially dynamic, forming a life direction which fulfils and continues to stimulate, even though it may be highly challenging and results may seem slow in coming.

Your mind will be very active, searching, questioning, and naturally explorative, allied with an intuitive creative need for self-expression. It will be important to be personally assertive, but undue eccentricity is not your style. Due to that positive solar relationship, you will feel more centered, forming a stable inner character and extending an ability to direct your life and make wiser choices. Tolerance and understanding of others will be more evident, especially an intellectually derived tolerance based on your innate humanitarian instincts, although often your emotional affinity with others can be a little cold or withdrawn. You do not feel at one with this world, yet intellectually your mind is; perhaps more empathy is required. You are likely to contribute to groups which support social reform, and have an attitude of ''changing the world to be a better place for everyone to live in''. Probably you could rise to important positions in such groups, transmitting your enthusiasms and positivity by becoming a spokesperson for their visions and ideals. Your opinions are usually forthright, and you try to stay true and committed to your beliefs.

Equally, it could lead you to break away from groups that you are associated with, if they - in your opinion - fall to such low levels or compromise and fail to live up to the high ideals which they may offer to the public. You believe that life has an inner meaning of great value, and continually search for the threads of this throughout your life, trusting in the belief that life is good, often despite appearances.

The Jupiterian quality of expansiveness is very potent, stimulating excess expansion in your actions and attitudes, tempting you consistently to overreach your actual capabilities. You may lack patience, planning abilities, self-discipline and persistence, and these will work against your ambitions succeeding, even though attaining your aims may be highly motivating. It is not that you are incapable of success, but that your approach sows seeds of future failure as you pass. If this has happened in your life, then acknowledge it, and realize that future progress can be made if certain inner changes are taken. The first step is to ensure that you determine your intentions and aims, and how you can proceed to accomplishment. As your desires and dreams can be varied and multiple, focusing your path may prove difficult, and you may need to pursue a thorough re-evaluation of your priorities and major needs in order to gain clarity of purpose. Moving too quickly can often lead to failure due to ill-considered plans, so you may need to stop and think more deeply before jumping into action, or pay more attention to the advice of others. A careful assessment of your current capabilities is required, so that they match the level needed for your goals; working with talents tends to expand latent potential, but a requisite level of skills is initially necessary. A more realistic appreciation of time is essential, or else you will feel your frustrations rising if success does not happen quickly. Excessive optimism and enthusiasm may need to be warily reined back, as do restless tendencies for changes in life, which can become more disruptive than helpful unless properly understood. The areas of life especially affected are the houses and signs which are ruled and occupied by the Sun and Jupiter, and it is through those spheres that you may over-expand or seek fulfillment within. If you sincerely wish to transform any pattern of frustration in your life, then becoming more realistic, mature and self-controlled will begin to show benefits, especially if you are systematically disciplined to overcome obstacles as they arise. Accepting that failure need never be permanent, or that success is never final or guaranteed, can offer you a more balanced perspective to view your progress. Modifying your attitudes towards life challenges so that they become opportunities for development and growth, instead of perpetuating attitudes of adversarial conflict imposed by a universe intent on thwarting your dreams, will ensure that every experience can bring something of potential value to use as a foundation for your eventual success. Balance and moderation may need to be consciously developed in your nature and life-style, and extravagance or ostentatious tendencies may need to be controlled due to that pattern of excessive consumption that could be adopted as a compensation for other areas of personal failure. Learning to use your energies and time carefully is important, as you may waste them by futile pursuits. Unlocking latent creative potential may be difficult, yet if you can do so this may open several new doors of opportunity, liberating blocked inner energies and providing the key to future success. In relationships, you may need to guard against tendencies to manipulate people, as this will rarely work to your ultimate advantage; there will always be some other puppet master capable of pulling your strings. Similarly, attempts to distort information for your own aims will equally be turned back against you by others also adroit at such tactics. Treating people honestly and directly is the best approach, and you should possess good communication skills which could be applied to transform blockages and obstacles.

(2243, 0, 'us', 'sun-square-neptune', 7, 'This indicates tendencies of psychologically based inhibitions, restrictions and frustrations which pose considerable challenges that need overcoming before the more positive characteristics of Neptune and the Sun emerge. You tend to lack confidence in your identity and ability to achieve your ambitions. Part of this may have been derived from your parental relationships, especially with the father, as your developing nature may have experienced conflict through lack of understanding or of perceived love; it may have been that by asserting your own individuality you clashed with the stronger parental will. The results are that your self-confidence has fragmented, and that your application of will is less focused and effective, and consequently you have developed psychological defenses against others and from facing personal failure. This is displayed in escapism, and avoidance of responsibilities and of the need for self-discipline, unless a powerful Saturn in your chart can re-balance this tendency. Preferring to run away from confronting reality leads to distorted perceptions, which make careful evaluation of options difficult as well as generating fears of making decisions which may prove to be unwise. At its worst, this can create inertia through fear of taking deliberate action. These inner images of failure tend to create external failures, and so emphasize a repetitive vicious circle. Yet by linking this pattern of failure within aims and ambitions that are probably beyond your current capabilities to achieve, you also succeed in evading the realization that you are creating most failures in your life. This is exacerbated by the dreams of the unintegrated and unfulfilled Neptune, who may be noticed as a thread of guilt related to your lack of achievement, and as an ongoing sensation of discontent. Your solar power is being diverted and dissolved by the activity of an unintegrated Neptune, and, unless you can begin to reassert this solar centre and face your Neptunian challenges, this unsatisfactory condition may continue. These challenges can be mitigated by a decision to make sufficient effort to connect to your hidden solar centre, to move beyond those superimposed images of guilt, failure and inferiority that have developed as a defensive response to emotional pain. Such a reorientation may not be easy to make, as you will be opposing established patterns of behaviour, yet the gains that can be made are likely to transform your life. The first step is self-acceptance, to cease any self-judgment and condemnation. Then, if you really want it to happen, feel confident that any change can occur. You have sufficient inner creativity, imagination and potential waiting to be released from imprisonment, although finding appropriate channels of expression may still take a little longer. However, you need to define any ambitions within a more realistic perspective than previously. Possibly some form of counseling may be effective in helping you gain more clarity regarding your self-potential, or workshops in self-assertion and decision-making / goal-setting. In effect, you are being asked to see yourself as a young child, ready to enter adulthood, and you are expected to recreate yourself into a new and more suitable identity. Take smaller and easily achievable steps in this process of recreation; acknowledge that occasional failures are inevitable, but try not to turn them into traumatic dramas, and realize that success will not happen without the parallel risk of failure side by side. Everybody is a failure at something, and that isn''t an excuse to condemn yourself again. As your self-confidence grows, your life will begin to take a more positive shape. It will not happen overnight, as transforming long-established behaviour patterns cannot be achieved that quickly; but persevere, and changes can happen. Perhaps using techniques like creative visualization and affirmations, or subliminal programming encoded on self-development cassette tapes, could strengthen this process. The essential realization is that change is possible, and that you can achieve this in your own way; in hope lies the fountainhead of the waters of potential and transformation. Such improvements can benefit your intimate relationships too, as well as enhance your self-image, confidence and decision-making abilities. Generally you are emotionally vulnerable, possibly exploited or abused by others, deceived or manipulated in various ways; but if these tendencies exist, they are reflections of those dominating patterns within you. There can be unusual emotional needs and desires linked with romantic idealism that are expressed in physical sexuality; these may require healing and cleansing in some way.

You may feel that your success is being frustrated by the world, which appears to confront you by obstacles on your way. Much depends on your reactions to such experiences, and your inner attitudes will determine how you deal with them. At times, you can seem almost over-assertive or aggressive, and this can diminish opportunities for co-operative endeavors to develop, especially when you fail to notice your effect on others, or inadvertently ignore their feelings and sensitivities. Often this is just an overreaction to your fears in relating to people, and instead of relaxing more, you tend to project through your tightness an over dominant energy that others can find uncomfortable. Alternatively, you could retreat back into a surrendered posture of passivity to life''s challenges, defeated before you start. Certainly learning how to live with any restrictions imposed by Saturn may be a necessary form of adjustment, although this should not imply a resignation to them, but merely a conscious modification to circumstances and a consequent step to transcend them later. The choice is yours to reshape your lifestyle patterns into a way that is more suitable and open to development. Self-expression and creativity may feel restricted, although this is often dependent on your confidence in your abilities and self-image, rather than on any lack of talents and qualities. Being able to perceive yourself in a positive light may become a key to your success, because that would also alter your relationships with others. There may be an emotional reserve and lack of warmth in your social contacts, so that you feel uncomfortable in bridging social divides and entering deeper relationships. Co-operation may need further development, and that air of formality and strictness may have to be relaxed so that friendships or partnerships can be more easily formed. The need for relaxation is present in both your outer and inner relationships. You may be unable to see your nature and direction clearly and this creates an insecurity which destabilizes your self-esteem. Personal tightness and control may need to be relinquished, and greater self-relaxation would be highly beneficial, especially in changing certain attitudes and increasing your physical vitality which periodically can become low as the energy is diverted towards restraints. Becoming looser, more tolerant, accepting and understanding would act as a great liberator, or you may begin to bow under the strain of those self-imposed restrictions, especially as your enjoyment of life progressively diminishes. A new inner balance and self-image is necessary. As this is achieved, any outer frustrations will correspondingly start to dissolve in equal measures to the increase in your self-confidence and clarified inner perspective. While initially it may appear as if the outer world and people are opposing you, it is this same source which can offer great opportunities as your changes proceed.

Discovering adequate forms is important to anchor the Uranian energy successfully, so evoking that Sun centre cohesiveness is essential in dealing with the highly charged Uranian energy and is common to all these aspects made to natal Uranus. This is a perpetual Sun-Uranian task. You can be erratic, individualistic, restless and nervously agitated, desiring independence and freedom from all social restrictions. it is even likely that your tendency to dissent can lead you to become socially isolated and alienated from others or radical groups with whom you are in basic agreement. If unmodified, and released indiscriminately, this energy is quite capable of ''causing trouble in an empty house''. Being the devil''s advocate is a function that can often lead to confusion and loss of self, as eventually you either erode or lose sight of your own attitudes, beliefs or ideals, and this displaces you from strengthening your solar centre. Even if the majority hold a certain opinion or belief, then that alone can require you to reject it and to oppose its validity. From a more inclusive perspective there can be some truth in such a standpoint, as the majority viewpoint is often that of ''the lowest common denominator'' and can reflect the most separative beliefs and opinions. You can be undisciplined, hating those predictable routines of life and work, often finding it hard to act responsibly and with full commitment. You react against conforming to social rules, feeling that they constrain your freedom, and you often follow your choices, irrespective of the repercussions and costs of doing so. You will probably fail to listen to well-meaning advice, and a stubborn need for self-assertion can lead you towards those very experiences and problems that you were being warned against. If you look honestly at your life, you will observe those times where you misjudged, making foolish decisions and choices often through sheer contrariness and by asserting your ''free individuality''. Without awareness, no-one is ever free, but is merely a prisoner to their own unconscious tendencies, a prey to them, like playthings of the inner gods. At times you may become a little paranoid, especially when your choices have been unwise, influenced by less conscious and unintegrated forces in your psyche. It does not have to be like that. You can choose to take a more direct conscious role in your life, and not be a victim of your own ignorance. The square can be an aspect of frustrated blocked transformation and renewal; the inner personal revolution that both Sun and Uranus would like to bring is being blocked. These inner tensions can become potentially violent, and need to be redirected into constructive positive channels. You need to release any tendencies towards impracticality, antisocial attitudes and hidden urges for personal power, to stop being antagonistic purely for the sake of performing the adversarial role, and use the freed energies to renew your own life. As is probably recognised, you like others to be submissive to you, yet tend to lose respect for their individuality when they fall into that pattern of behaviour. You need to learn how to respect and elevate their uniqueness because that is the corollary of your ''trip'' and ''philosophy''. Emotional depths need to be stirred more, letting those poisons of frustration and emotional conflicts rise to the surface to be encountered and understood, releasing and transmuting them by accepting them as a shadow part of yourself which should be acknowledged and never denied.\r\n\r\n                      \r\n\r\n                ', 0, 0, 0, '', '', '', '2016-12-21 04:49:59'),
