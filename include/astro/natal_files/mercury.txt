Mercury blending with Ascendant
You are restless, high-strung and have a lot of nervous energy which makes it difficult for you to relax and settle down. You like to be on the go and involved with several projects all at the same time. Your mind is active and you are continually on the search for new ideas and information. You need the stimulus of communicating with others and you do not like to be left alone for very long at a time. It is sometimes difficult for you to stop your brain from racing here and there and sometimes you wish you just had a switch so you could turn it on and off in order to get some peace.

Mercury blending with Jupiter
You like to look at and plan things from the larger viewpoint. You are not as good at working with detail as you are in seeing the big picture. Your ideas are always on a grand scale and you do not like to get bogged down in trivialities. Because of your great optimism you may promise more than you can deliver. You have the tendency to exaggerate whatever it is you are talking about, including yourself and perhaps your own abilities. There are times when you just plain talk too much or say the same things over and over, figuring maybe you weren't understood or heard the first time you said them. You have the tendency to check and re-check things over and over even though you know they were fine the first time, like setting the alarm clock or checking to see if you locked the front door. At times you can be impractical because of the scale of your visions. Travel is especially interesting to you as it gives you a chance to be exposed to and soak up new knowledge. You are always ready to let other people know what your opinions and viewpoints are, even though they haven't asked. Philosophical speculation and theorizing about abstract concepts are fun for you. You're always ready to play Devil's advocate even if you happen to agree with your opponent's point of view. You just like a good discussion, argument or debate. You enjoy mental sparring matches.

You are interested in the broad view, in universal principles and systems, in seeing connecting relationships and patterns, and in seeing the whole picture rather than the component parts. You have great respect and thirst for knowledge and education is very important to you, whether it is the formal kind or the informal kind that continues long past college days. You love to teach and to pass on your knowledge and experiences to others. As a teacher you learn as much from your students as they learn from you because you are always questioning and wondering about this and that. Writing and speaking are also two avenues that you may pursue and it wouldn't be surprising if you had some sort of connection to broadcasting, publishing or advertising. You are a natural salesperson and people tend to trust you and believe what you tell them.

You are perhaps better at dreaming up schemes than in implementing them. You are just as happy if someone else does the actual work after you have thought up what needs doing. You have a direct, open, frank and honorable mental attitude and you do not go around intentionally trying to deceive people. Your optimism and faith in the future help you succeed in all your activities. At times you can display a certain stubbornness of mind and thought. You like variety and want to be as accomplished as possible in as many areas as you can be. Just be careful that you do not end up the Jack-of-all-trades and the master of none, unless, of course, that is really what you want for yourself.

Mercury blending with Mars
You have an alert, quick and ready mind for any mental activity, exercise or game. You love a good debate and you are ever-ready to learn more about almost anything. You love to read and it is perhaps the way you get most of your information. You enjoy working on several projects at a time and you probably have some sort of mechanical ability. You love working with your hands and you may even be ambidextrous. When you speak, you not only speak with your mouth but with your hands as well. There may be mathematical or scientific ability with this aspect. Along with a sharp mind comes a sharp tongue. At times you display no tact whatsoever when you speak your mind and you need to learn to think before you speak. Hoof-in-mouth syndrome is something that is all too familiar with you. You love sarcasm and you don't mind a little good-natured taunting, either on the giving end or the receiving end. You generally express your thoughts in a clear, decisive, forceful and convincing style. You have leadership abilities and can talk up a storm, whether you really know what you are talking about or not. A little b.s. never hurt anyone, right? You love pointing out the flaws and discrepancies in someone else's arguments. You can be verbally aggressive and abrasive at times and there are times where you overstate your case or offend people by your unadorned frankness. You can be an effective spokesperson, lawyer or salesperson. You have the power to persuade just from using the sheer force of words. You may have writing talent and ability as well, particularly geared toward criticism or satire. You love mental challenges. You are quite independent, determined, courageous, with the energy to succeed in life. Learn to think before speaking, though, since you could easily lose friends through your bluntness and sarcasm.

Mercury blending with Neptune
You tend to daydream and let your imagination run away with you. You are idealistic, visionary, imaginative and perhaps psychic. There is a decided lack of willpower at times and you are many times content just to flow with the tides of life rather than taking an active participation in directing your own path. You are attracted to the arts and have creative talent and ability with painting, poetry and especially music. If you do not play a stringed instrument, then at least you are attracted to the sounds they make. Their music is like hearing a voice from your true home in the spirit worlds. Because of your sensitiveness, you are sometimes easily led without your knowledge as the power of suggestion has great effect on you. Important character changes are difficult for you to make as things are not seen clearly. There is danger through drugs and alcohol and you would be wise to stay away from them. You may not have as large a backbone as others and for this reason it is important that you watch what sorts of influences and environments you surround yourself with. You are not the steadiest of people. Stay away from all negative psychic influences such as Ouija boards, séances, hypnotism and mediums. Your mind does not function in a linear, logical manner and you are often unable to express your thoughts in simple, everyday language. Symbols, images, art, or music better express your ideas. For this reason you may not do as well in formal book-learning situations as in simply having someone tell you or show you something firsthand. Flights of imagination and fantasy carry you into strange and beautiful worlds and you could develop the ability to write down some of your perceptions to share with others, for example, by writing fantasy, fiction, lyrics, or poetry. You are sensitive to nuances and innuendo, but may become confused between imagination and true perception. You may have difficulty concentrating your attention on practical or mundane activities or in separating truth from fiction. You are attracted to the metaphysical and the mystical. There may be interest in photography. There may be problems with the nerves and you perhaps need to take a little time every day for some peace and quiet. This aspect is very beneficial to writers, especially of romance or adventure novels, for musicians and for actors.

Stories of mystery, intrigue, espionage, science fiction, etc. are favorite reading for you. You may have a morbid side to you because of all this interest in underground or undercover subjects. But that is not the way you see it at all. You just want to learn everything you can about subjects that most people couldn't care less about. You have strong opinions with the power to influence others. Some may think you are almost fanatical or obsessive about your beliefs or what you choose to direct your thinking upon.

You are unconventional, weird, a bit eccentric and you demand complete freedom of expression. New ideas, discoveries and inventions thrill you to no end. You love keeping up with the latest state-of-the-art theories and products.

You may be attracted to electronics, astrology or astronomy and metaphysics in general. You have a decidedly high-strung and nervous temperament and you find it difficult to relax.

Mercury blending with Venus
You can appreciate the finer, more aesthetic things of life because you have a well-developed sense of form, proportion, design and beauty. With such skills you could perhaps be successful as an artist, sculptor, fashion designer, craftsmen, interior decorator, creative writer or jewelry designer. This aspect usually gives talent in the arts, whether it be writing, poetry, speaking or musical ability. You may possess a lovely singing voice.

If you do not have artistic talent yourself, then you certainly have a fine appreciation of art, in all its many forms. You are a natural at settling arguments and soothing hurt feelings.

You love to read and soak up knowledge. Your mind is always full of ideas and you can present them with a self-confidence and force that is very persuading to others. You have a sense of humor that is more satirical or sarcastic than it is outrightly funny. You are good with your hands and may be ambidextrous.

You have an aptitude for research, private investigation, detective work, psychology and anything having to do with death or life after death. You are drawn to occult or esoteric studies and want to get to the truth. You prefer depth of knowledge rather than breadth of knowledge. You do not disclose your intentions easily, although you want to know what everyone else is up to or planning.

Mercury harmonizing with Uranus
You possess lightning-quick physical and mental responses to stimuli of all kinds. You have an electric nature about you that won't let you sit still. You love being involved with several projects at the same time because you do not like to be bored. You are open-minded, independent, original, eccentric, creative, unusual, a bit of a genius and a free-thinker. New ideas and concepts are important to you and you encourage everyone you come into contact with to experiment and try new things. You are intuitive and many insights come from your Higher Self. You like an unstructured environment free from rules and regulations where you can respond to the needs of the moment. Routine, repetitive work makes you nuts. Your mind functions in an intuitive, nonlinear fashion and sudden insights and flashes of inspiration often come to you "out of the blue". You hate being told what to do and how to do it.

You love mental challenges and are quick to take up the cue in any argument or debate. You have a lot of nervous energy and can't sit still for long. You prefer intellectual people and you like to challenge their thinking and ideas. At times you may have a lack of clarity in expressing your thoughts. There are moments, too, when you simply talk too much.

*
Mercury discordant to Jupiter
You are optimistic, but perhaps overly so. You make promises you don't or can't keep. You exaggerate the telling of any story for greater effect. You may have little or no faith in a higher power because you can't make sense of the whole issue. You love working with the big picture and want someone else to do the detailed work. You have a penchant for checking and re-checking things multiple times, just to be sure you did something in the first place, like checking to see if you really set the alarm or if you really locked the front door. You tend to do more rather than less. For example, if a recipe calls for a tablespoon, you may add a tablespoon and a half. You figure if this much is fine, then a little more makes things better. You may be intolerant of other people's beliefs, habits or cultures. You tend to gloss over details that come back to haunt you later and you have the propensity to overestimate the potential of an idea or product. You are not intentionally mean-spirited, it's just that you get carried away with yourself and this can be detrimental at times. You have an abundance of ideas, interests, and plans for the future, but you may find it difficult to focus on any particular area. You may devote yourself and your energies to some irrational cause. Philosophy, religion, or other areas of theoretical speculation interest you.

You also possess foresight, numerous enterprising ideas, and a gambling instinct, all of which contribute to your success in the world of business. You love to travel, especially if there is some mind-expanding or educational aspect involved with it. There is a love of communicating your thoughts and ideas to others and you may very well be an excellent teacher, formal or otherwise. You need to learn how to discipline yourself so that you think problems through logically, clearly and with full knowledge of the facts. You have a tendency to rush through your thoughts or to be sloppy in your thinking, and perhaps even in your penmanship. Your thoughts go too far, you can get carried away with them, making grandiose plans that are too expansive to be put into concrete reality. Yet, you do seem to be extremely uncritical of others and accept them just as you find them. At times you are absent-minded, even though your mind is very original and fertile. You may have literary or speaking talent. Guard against jumping to conclusions, bad judgment and over-optimism. You have a knack for putting together unrelated ideas and concepts and making something out of them. At times others will take advantage of you because of your sympathetic nature and generosity. You may have the tendency, also, of talking too much, using more words to say something than what it really requires or repeating several times what you have already just said.

*
Mercury discordant to Mars
You have the capacity to be very clever and cunning, trying to take advantage of anyone if you get the chance. Your mind is alert, quick and always ready for an argument. Your speech is sometimes too hasty and you lack tact. Your tongue is a sword you use to lash out at other people when they have upset you or done something you did not like. You have a temper that can explode into swearing, name-calling and general ranting and raving. You are a convincing and forceful speaker and you have a way of bringing people over to your way of thinking, but you are not especially receptive to the ideas and opinions of others. You need to better learn how to rationally and logically control your desires. Your mental energy should be directed into creative channels instead of wasted in conflicts with others. You are irritable and fault-finding at times and this turns friends and family against you. You are argumentative and rather critical and aggressive in discussions and you like turning any conversation into a debate or verbal war. Try to choose an occupation where this talent is a plus and not a minus. Perhaps you could be a spokesman for a righteous cause, a lawyer vigorously defending a client, an analyst or critic. You love to read and you may have literary talent.

You are high-strung and have a lot of nervous energy, thus you find it hard to sit still for very long. You love working on several projects at the same time because it keeps you from getting bored, but you may have difficulty finishing the things you have started. You need to take time out occasionally and give your mind a break so that it does not become overstrained. Inner tension and hostility find their outlet in angry outbursts, sometimes making little sense to listeners. Your anger destroys your ability to think clearly and so you are unable to logically present the reasons for your anger. Since your nerves are also stretched taut, you must be careful or you may suffer from some type of nervous disorder, such as shingles or an ulcer. Anger is very detrimental to the heart, also. You have a tendency to overwork, which is very hard on both your physical body and your nerves. Your approach to life can be too much hustle and bustle, with a lot of running around and nothing being accomplished. Slow down once in a while and chill out.

*
Mercury discordant to Neptune
You tend to be very imaginative and very visionary, but it is hard for you to put your thoughts and ideas into practical, everyday terms. You may occasionally be accused of cloudy thinking and of letting your imagination run wild. Having visions and wonderful ideas is great, but if you can't implement them in the real world, then much of their use and effectiveness is lost. You need to learn how to discipline your mind so that something real can come of your brilliant inspirations.

When problems become too much for you, you re-create the situation in your mind with the ending you prefer, until you become convinced the new ending is reality. You may have a tendency to run away from the world and its problems. Finding supposed shelter in drugs or alcohol only compounds any problems you have in the first place. Although it may be uncomfortable or even painful, you must learn to face your problems head-on as they will not go away if you ignore them.

At times you are very absent-minded and forgetful and there have been a number of others who have thought of you as an air-head. You are not stupid, it's just that your focus and concentration is on another plane. Of course, we do have to live down here on earth, so it would be wise for you to be off in the clouds only when the situation is appropriate. Communication with others may be difficult at times because you are not always clear on what it is that you want to say. Either that, or you describe things in such terms that no one understands what you're saying. Use your ability for artistic expression to communicate your thoughts. Much of your inability to communicate with others is because you are not concentrating. There are times, too, when you perhaps purposely try to mystify or deceive others. You have great difficulty in paying attention and concentrating on anything for very long, except of course, your daydreams.

You may have the tendency to believe in everything you hear or to be just the opposite and believe nothing unless you see hard and fast proof. You do not see the world around you accurately, hence you are prone to faulty conclusions. Your mind is highly imaginative and creative and you possess dramatic, artistic, or musical abilities. You perceive things that others do not grasp and understand and you have an amazing ability to read people and situations without being told anything about them. You have a love of mystery and are attracted to metaphysics or occult science, but you need to stay away from negative psychic practices such as Ouija boards, séances, hypnotism and mediums. There is a need for you to learn to discriminate truth from fiction and reality from fantasy. You are accused of being a liar at times and it is hard to tell whether you know the difference between truth and falsehood or that you are simply trying to be deceitful on purpose. Some clear thinking on your part could prevent others from getting the feeling that you are intentionally misleading them. You must learn to discipline and focus your mind if you wish to use all your creative talents. You are not particularly good at formal book-learning because you tend to absorb knowledge in an indirect way. It is easier for you to pick up things by having someone tell, describe or show something to you instead of your trying to read about it and understand what you've read. You may have literary talent as you are excellent in describing anything imaginatively. You are a great story-teller. Be careful of the people and environments with which you associate as you are very sensitive to vibrations and tend to soak up the atmosphere that surrounds you.

Lastly, you may have a highly geared nervous system which can cause impatience and irritability. You must learn when you need to give your mind a rest.

You tend to have a very suspicious, even paranoid, side. You need to learn not to be so intensely involved with your own ideas and beliefs, as some of your beliefs may be downright fanatical. When others do not believe the same way as you, you may have a tendency to get angry or self-righteous. You need to learn to listen calmly to other viewpoints and consider whether yours is in error. Be big enough to admit when you are wrong. The attitude you may have that you are always right is just not reality. Keep an open mind before ridiculing any idea. This aspect can give the "doubting Thomas" tendency whereby you believe in nothing unless the evidence is displayed to you first-hand. The only real way you can find the proof you want is for you to learn to tap your own Higher Self in order to find the truth from your own inner wisdom.

You are practical and deliberate and you have difficulty expressing your affection for others. You have a tendency toward tooth decay.

Mental cruelty is possible. You tend to have fears and worries that are unreasonable. Instead of planning you focus on worry. You are distrustful or fearful of anything you cannot understand with your rational mind. You should develop more awareness so that you do not interpret what others say to you in a negative manner. You may have difficulties in verbally communicating what you mean to say to others, so that misunderstandings occur on both sides. You are such a conservative in your thinking that you prefer to stay with ideas that work for you rather than adopting new ones. It would at times, though, be to your advantage and listen to new concepts and to try them occasionally. Be careful that you do not get into the habit of rationalizing everything such that any means to an end is acceptable as long as you believe it. You have a tendency to go to extremes with details. Some of the details are not important. There is a tendency to strain on the nervous system through stress or overwork.

You are a lightning quick thinker who is constantly coming up with new ways of doing things. You have an intuitive genius for originality. You are unconventional, weird, a bit eccentric and you demand complete freedom of expression. New ideas, discoveries and inventions thrill you to no end. You love keeping up with the latest state-of-the-art theories and products. Because you grasp ideas so quickly, you may have difficulty being patient with those around you who do not pick up on things as quickly as you do. You understand scientific and mechanical theory easily. You are indeed blessed with a sharp, brilliant, swift and clever mentality. You may be attracted to electronics, astrology or astronomy and metaphysics in general. You have a decidedly high-strung and nervous temperament and you find it difficult to relax. You get bored rather easily so you need lots of things going on at the same time. You enjoy travel as there is always something new to learn or think about. Your mind functions in an intuitive, non-linear fashion, and sudden insights and ideas often come to you "out of the blue". You do well in open, unpredictable atmospheres where flexibility and quick responses are required. You are self-reliant and demand freedom of thought and expression at all times.

But, you have the tendency that if ideas do not fit in with your previously conceived pattern, then they are simply rejected. Your interest in knowing about everything can dissipate your mental focus and concentration. You tend to scatter your energies into too many directions at once and to make impulsive or hasty decisions. You jump from one thing to another without finishing what you've started. Your mind is rather antagonistic towards the ideas of others so that you have a tendency to disbelieve them out of hand. But, if your own mind comes to the same conclusion, then you find it totally believable. You usually like new ideas, but you don't want them "preached" to you. Thus, it's important for you to realize that others are not necessarily "preaching" to you when they present different viewpoints. Discipline yourself to stay with a subject long enough to master it. You may be carrying a chip around on your shoulder that is most unattractive. Let it go and become detached.
