
This natal report is shortened considerably since you do not know your exact time of birth. Without an exact time of birth, no Ascendant (rising sign) or house positions of planets can be calculated. Also, no aspects to or from the Moon or Ascendant have been given.

The astrological interpretations in this report have been formulated with the assumption that your birth date, time, and place are accurately given. This includes whether the birth time was daylight savings time or standard time. Even a difference of one hour in birth time can invalidate much of the interpretation given in this report, most notably 'HOUSE POSITIONS OF PLANETS' and 'THE RISING SIGN OR ASCENDANT'.

By no means is this astrological analysis complete. Obviously, you are far more complex than what a few pages of writing can depict. Hopefully, this short description of you and your inner character will lead you on your way to really discovering who you are, what you can become, and what you need to be doing in this life.
