Jupiter discordant to Ascendant

Jupiter discordant to Neptune
You have the tendency to be way too emotional at times. Periodically you get excessively sentimental, romantic and idealistic. Sometimes your imagination runs away from you. Dreams and ideas are great but not when they interfere with reality and the practical, everyday duties and responsibilities that must be faced in order to lead a productive life. People sometimes take advantage of you because you tend to be a sucker for sob stories. Sometimes you enjoy playing the victim or the martyr in order to draw attention to yourself or to get sympathy. You are periodically manipulated into doing what others want you to do even if you would rather not be doing it. Or perhaps you are the one who is accomplished at lying, manipulation or laying guilt trips on other people, especially those in your family. You may have a distorted sense of the truth. What is in your head might be totally different than what is in reality. All this suggests that you need to practice more mental and emotional discipline and learn how to better keep your feet on the ground.

Be wary of speculative ventures or get-rich-quick schemes as your tendency is to suffer loss through these because of fraud. Temper your optimism with realism. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. Everything has its cost. Learn to accept people, their faults and the world as they are and not how you wish them to be. You are apt to view some people through rose-colored glasses and others through jaundiced eyes. If you place people on pedestals, and if they fall off, you become disillusioned, not only with the idolized individual, but with the world. You have high ideals, but by accepting life and people as they are, you can release the disappointments and disillusionments you suffer over human failings. Avoid negative psychic influences such as Ouija boards, hypnosis, séances and mediums. These things could be dangerous for you. Drugs and the excessive use of alcohol should also be avoided.

Jupiter discordant to Pluto
You may need to learn to better respect other people's opinions, beliefs and viewpoints. Others at times think you are too full of yourself. Practicing a bit more humility would draw people closer to you. You have executive ability and know how to get things done. It's just that you may not be sensitive enough to other people's needs or enough aware of what you are asking them to do. It is important to you to believe that you are always right. This agitates others because no one can be right all the time, and that is the impression they have of you — that you think you are always right. Be open-minded regarding the suggestions and ideas of others. Admit that you may not know it all and that there is room for further discovery. Be tolerant, avoid fanatical ideas and expression, and help those around you by using your power and leadership abilities to serve others rather than for simply gratifying your ego.

Jupiter discordant to Saturn
You may be subject to bouts of fear, worry and depression which make you feel as if you do not have enough material resources to live a reasonable life. These emotions can make you miserly and stingy. Your concern that you may not have enough for that proverbial rainy day can take all the fun and enjoyment out of day-to-day existence. So you keep trying to build up your reserves as your fear grows. You lose your enthusiasm, your generosity and your faith. You cannot allow this to happen. All that you need will be yours if you simply have faith and set your sights on seeking the God within. "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you". Remember and practice that and things will improve.

You must also not allow yourself to set too high a standard of accomplishment so that if it does not transpire that you lose all drive and incentive to keep working towards your goals. Be patient with yourself and just keep plugging away for "little by little does the trick". Give yourself time to reach the heights you aspire to. After all, you probably have more time than any other commodity. Use time to your advantage — don't let it be your enemy. If you don't stick to your goals and ambitions, then you may end up as one who continually hops from this to that, accomplishing nothing in the process, except having to learn the same old lessons over and over. You have many skills and abilities, but you need to learn how to discipline yourself to finish what you start. An inner restlessness suggests that you keep several projects open at the same time so you can move from one to another to alleviate any boredom that might develop. Most of all, you absolutely must learn to accept yourself as you are, limitations and all.

Jupiter discordant to Uranus
Perhaps your most problematic tendency with this aspect is that you tend to jump from one thing to another so quickly that you never learn much about anything. You can certainly become a sort of Jack-of-all-trades with this aspect, but is that going to get you anywhere? To be successful at life requires concentration of some sort. Continually hopping from this to that doesn't get the job done. In addition, you should watch that you do not become so enveloped, rigid or self-righteous about your goals and philosophies that you try to force everyone into believing what you believe. Develop an open and tolerant mind and you will find that the Universe sends less antagonizing situations your way. Faithfully following whatever philosophy seems like Truth to you is fine, just don't inflict your beliefs on those who are not ready or able to accept them. Avoid religious fanaticism, rebellion and anarchy and respect other people's right to believe in their truths also.

You tend to be independent, expansive and creative, with strong willpower and great determination. These characteristics are of immeasurable help to you in succeeding in life. Pursue the inspiration and avoid the unrealistic gamble. Be tolerant of slower-thinking individuals. You have a very keen and sharp mind with lightning reflexes and you must remember that not everyone can keep up with you and your fast pace. You have much to teach others, but only if you are willing to work at their speed rather than your own. One last thing, since you reserve the right to think as you please, you must grant others that same right.
