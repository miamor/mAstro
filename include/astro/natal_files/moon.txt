You do not enjoy confrontation and become very evasive when problems in your personal life arise, escaping into your imagination in order to avoid dealing with them directly. You are rather gullible and naive about people, especially if your sympathy has been aroused. You need to learn how to sort the truth from the untruth and to overcome your emotional sensitivity. Because of your great sensitivity, when upset or hurt, you may use lies to untangle yourself from a situation. Your emotional sensitivity does not always enable you to discern when others are telling you the truth or not, so you can be deceived by others with little effort on their part. You are too easily hurt by almost anyone. Your deep feelings of insecurity and inferiority cause you to withdraw from others into a world of make-believe. Your confusion at times causes you to misunderstand what has been said, so that you feel hurt and rejected. There is deception from others or through your own fantasy.

Moon discordant to Pluto
You have intense desires, emotions and feelings and your personal relationships are deeply emotional, passionate, and often stormy and painful as well. You have a magnetic personality that draws people to you. Your relationships with others tend to be obsessive and compulsive. There is much jealousy and possessiveness and each of you tries to control the other in as many different ways as possible. You are manipulative and not just in subtle ways. You resort to guilt, innuendo and outright false accusations in order to keep your hold on others. Your feelings can be so compelling at times that you do things that are not at all rational.

You have difficulty listening to the ideas and suggestions of others. You feel a need to be right all the time. You find it hard to forgive and forget. You need to develop an awareness so that you see others as they really are and not as you wish them to be. Your emotions are especially strong and difficult for you to control. You may become obsessed over security or money. Your challenge here is to learn how to control the emotional turmoil that is inside you. It is difficult for you to totally trust those you love, because you fear you will eventually be rejected due to your supposed unworthiness. Because of this, you are constantly tested in your relationships in order to bring about an inner growth. These lessons are designed to teach you to trust those you love and care for.

*
Moon discordant to Saturn
You are highly ambitious, but the real pitfall of this aspect is self-doubt. You do not trust yourself and your own capabilities, talents or skills. You believe that you don't have what it takes in order for people to like you. You have low self-esteem and low self-confidence. That is one reason why you are so busy working, trying to prove yourself to everyone. You are filled with insecurities and the fear of failure. You are afraid that what you have, as little as it might be, will be taken away from you. You are lonely and have a difficult time opening up and feeling close to others. You think that you can buy other people's affections and trust. That is not the way it works — you must earn it. You must also realize that others cannot love you until you first come to love yourself, then others after that. You need constant reassurance from others that you are loved, so much so that it may eventually become a burden on your loved ones. There is a strong need for you to re-evaluate the meaning of emotional security. You often feel that you must do something or be something other than what you really are in order to receive approval and acceptance from others. You are very sensitive to criticism and easily feel left out or neglected, and though you may appear cool or distant, you actually care very much about being included in things. Because you are so sensitive, it may seem easier for you to withdraw into a shell rather than risk the emotional bumps and bruises that can occur when you let others really know you in an intimate and personal way.

Your reserve and caution make establishing a close emotional rapport with others difficult for you. You can gain inner security and emotional strength through periods of solitude if you look at these periods as times where you can nourish yourself and develop your own interests, rather than as times of loneliness. You are subject to occasional bouts of depression, anxiety and frustration. There are delays and roadblocks set up in your path of accomplishment. At times it seems like the whole world is against you and that you have to carry the weight of the world entirely on your own shoulders. You need to learn to overcome your feelings of being totally alone in life. This isn't exactly true. These feelings stem from your inability to express your emotions, so that you feel separated from others. In previous lives, you have tried to love and to be affectionate, but you have been rejected and in this life you are afraid to love because you feel you may be rejected again. You need to learn that emotional security is based on a good philosophy of life and not on other people. Even though you are a controlled, serious and practical person, locked within you is a warm and affectionate person just waiting to get out. But that does involve taking the risk of being hurt again. There's no way around it. You learn through experience.

This is perhaps the single most powerful aspect you can have in a horoscope. Your greatest asset is your ability to learn by experience, for even though you have made many mistakes, your self-knowledge is your salvation. At the height of depression, despair or error you are able to look yourself squarely in the face and start building your way back to where you want to be. You have a jump on the others who are not assisted by the mental energy and psychological drive that this aspect gives.

Excitable, spontaneous, and enthusiastic about anything new, you may be perceived by others as being too impulsive, especially in personal relationships. You certainly do not want to feel tied down. It is not easy for you to keep your commitments or your promises because you don't know how you will be feeling from one day to the next. You do things on a whim. Your needs come before all others. Your domestic life tends to be very unstable, as do your relationships with women in general. You need to control your unpredictable emotional responses to others. At times you are quite distant and at other times you are very friendly. This confuses others. There are times when you are hesitant to get involved with other people since they may make demands on your freedom. You need to feel free, without any ties to anyone. The challenge here is to learn how to control your sudden, unpredictable emotional storms. When you are emotionally upset, you act without thinking. This makes you susceptible to accidents. You are a very high-strung, nervous person who has trouble sitting still for any length of time. You like unusual experiences and you enjoy shocking conventional people. Your desire for freedom makes it difficult for you to stay in any one place for very long or maybe even with one person. You need to learn to count to ten before blowing your cool in order to help yourself control your unpredictable outbursts.

Your habits may annoy others. You may have bad manners, bad breath or bad personal hygiene habits that irritate those around you. You can be lazy at times and you hate to get your hands dirty. You prefer other people doing the hard work while you sit around and reap the benefits or the glory. You know exactly how to tell people what they want to hear, regardless of whether it is really honest or not. You may have conflicting emotional desires and needs which complicate your personal life. Perhaps you are trying to please someone you care about so much so that you end up being some other person instead of yourself, becoming very unhappy in the process. You may have trouble figuring out just what you want in a relationship, a mother or a lover. If your needs for emotional satisfaction and love are not met, then overeating (especially sweets) can be a problem for you. You have a tendency anyway toward rich, sweet food and emotional imbalances set you to overeating as compensation for what you feel you are lacking. You are insecure and do not have a very high opinion of yourself. Perhaps you find yourself ugly or unattractive in some way, regardless of what the people around you tell you. You need to learn how to emotionally stand alone on your own two feet and to stand up for yourself and what you believe. You want and need the love of others in order to feel secure and if that love seems to be taken away, then you crumble. You are very warm and loving, but you must learn that you cannot possess anyone. We have all loved countless souls in all our previous incarnations here on earth and there is never a final farewell for love. You always are reunited with those you love. Anything to the contrary is an illusion.

Money goes out as fast as it comes in, sometimes faster. You have a tendency to be self-indulgent, over-extravagant and too desiring of luxury. You have the tendency to take the easy way out of things and to not stand up for your rights and needs. You are sensitive about your personal popularity. You may have an inferiority complex. The challenge is for you to develop the courage and learn how to voice your convictions. You have such a strong emotional need to be liked and accepted that you avoid making waves. By standing up for your personal convictions, you will build strength of character and will be free to be yourself. And this will make you a much happier person.
