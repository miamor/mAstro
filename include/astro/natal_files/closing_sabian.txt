
The astrological information in this report has been formulated with the assumption that your birth date, time, and place are accurately given. This includes whether the birth time was daylight savings time or standard time. Even a difference of one hour in birth time can invalidate some of the information given here.

By no means is this astrological analysis complete. Obviously, you are far more complex than what a few pages of writing can depict. Hopefully, this short description of you and your inner character will lead you on your way to really discovering who you are, what you can become, and what you need to be doing in this life.
