Sun blending with Ascendant
You have a sunny disposition and a nature that is proud and honorable. You do not stoop to low or mean acts because that is not becoming of you. You have a strong vital essence and you radiate vitality to those in your immediate circle. You are a natural leader and can do well in positions of management or authority. You are willing to help those in need and you give of yourself in a generous manner.

*
Sun blending with Jupiter
You have an abundant amount of optimism, self-confidence and cheerful generosity. Your good will, kind nature and friendliness make you popular with almost everyone. You have grand plans and ideas about everything and you believe that you are just the right person to head things up. You have the desire to succeed in life in a big way. You expect the best and usually get it, either through the thoughtful acts of others or because of your own hard work. This aspect brings much good luck, financial reward, enthusiasm and self-pride. The only real danger here is that you may tend to be somewhat over-indulgent, wasteful or extravagant. There is also danger of false pride and a rather inflated ego, though not in a mean sense. You are perhaps a bit of a spend-thrift, not much concerning yourself as to whether or not you should stick to some sort of budget. There is a yearning to know your true inner self and discover what the plan is for your life. You love travel and will probably have the opportunity to do so, perhaps because of your career. This is the aspect of the guardian angel. No matter how close the calls, you are somehow saved, if need be, in the very last moment. Spiritual forces watch over you and protect you from harm. Your kindness and generosity in past lives have brought this reward to you here and now, with all the attendant favors. Use them wisely.

Sun blending with Mars
You are full of vitality, energy and the force of life. You have an indomitable will that does not allow you to quit or to fail. You are assertive, active, courageous and passionate. You have a strong physical drive which expresses itself through passion and sexuality or through creative enterprises. You have a fighting spirit and a desire to compete with anyone, over anything. Your magnetic personality draws people to you. There is danger here of trying to do so much that you eventually burn yourself out. Take some time to rest along the way and you will find that you actually have accomplished more by taking periodic breaks. You are driven by your desire to create, whether in business or in your personal life. You have a victorious spirit and the will to win, whatever the odds. There is impulse, high energy, speed and intensity. But all that energy needs control, discipline and the proper channeling for it to be a constructive force. This is what you must learn to do. Use your willpower to direct the energies into constructive channels. You tend to be argumentative and combative. Physical exercise is important to you so that you can work off some of the stress that having all this energy generates. This aspect favors situations where strength and muscular exertion are needed. Along with all this you have the tendency to be selfish and to only think of your own needs. Your self-interests are much more important than anyone else's. Try to be a little more mindful of the needs of others before your own. With such powerful energies at work, you may have difficulty being humble and modest. Don't let your ego rage out of control. Remember, too, that "pride goeth before the fall".

Sun blending with Mercury
You have a tendency at times to see things from your perspective only. Occasionally you have trouble being objective because you can be pretty self-absorbed. You love to talk about yourself, your ideas and your views, but you aren't all that interested in listening to others do the same thing. You enjoy a clear mind, with a quick wit, and you have a love for learning and involving yourself in new experiences. You need constant mental stimulation and activity or you get bored. You have the ability to communicate your ideas to others and to win them over to your viewpoint, but you must watch a tendency to tune out what other people are saying. This happens because your mind is busily thinking about what you are going to say next and you pay no attention to them. You are rather high-strung and you may have the habit of biting your nails, cracking your knuckles or some other fidgety habit. Get yourself a hobby that requires the use of your hands so you won't be so anxious and annoying to others with your little idiosyncrasies. And work a little on being less self-centered.

*
Sun blending with Moon
The tendency here is for you to be rather one-sided. It is difficult for you to be objective and you have little or no appreciation for other, different ways of approaching life. You feel yours is the best way and you can't imagine how anyone else could be doing something different than you. It is hard for you to put yourself in other people's situations and understand just what things are like for them. You try, but you just don't have that ability. You tend to be impulsive. You need to learn to use your willpower to control the fluctuating emotional turmoils that stir within you. You can be extremely sensitive at times and you do not always take into consideration how your actions will affect other people. You are not unkind, just oblivious. Your vitality and constitution are generally strengthened with this aspect. In any case, though, there is the need for occasional rest to allow your system to recharge and recuperate. The vitality of the Sun can burn up the constitution of the Moon. You are apt to work on many projects all at the same time and it would be good if you could learn to develop more persistence. Oh, and a little patience, also.

*
Sun blending with Neptune
You are sensitive and imaginative and are attracted to artistic and creative pursuits, to mysticism, to photography or to drama and the theater. You are impressionable and receptive and you need to watch the people, environments and situations with which you associate as you tend to soak up the vibrations surrounding you, for good or ill. The power of suggestion works more easily with you, because of this aspect, than it does for others. There may be strange and mysterious things that happen to you that seemingly defy the rational mind. You have a lot of dreams, visions and yearnings, but may not possess the concentrated will and stamina to do anything with them or to bring them into reality. You are gentle, helpful, sympathetic and compassionate toward others, but you can be taken advantage of by someone with a good sob story. You like to help people in need, but you need to be discriminating about it. You have a need to express yourself creatively, most likely through the arts or through music. You do not like the harsher side of life and you try to avoid facing difficulties whenever you can. This tendency to hide may lead to turning to drugs or alcohol if you do not exercise the appropriate amount of self-control. Running away will not help solve any troubles you have. You are prone to procrastination. There are times when you can be completely self-deluded over what is going on around you. You may experience delusions of grandeur because there are moments when you cannot separate truth from fiction or reality from fantasy. You are emotional, sentimental, romantic and psychically attuned. Avoid any negative psychic practices such as Ouija boards, séances, hypnotism and mediums. You must not allow your tendency to daydream interfere with the responsibilities you have in life. People find it somewhat hard to understand you, but this makes sense seeing as you do not really understand yourself.

*
Sun blending with Pluto
You are an intense person with a great deal of willpower. Anything you set your mind to is waiting there for you to accomplish. You will not admit defeat, no odds are too great for you to overcome and there is no challenge that worries you. Inside you are quite a fanatic, though you may hide your personal desires and intentions and the intensity of your feelings. You feel driven by some deep, inner sense of destiny and there is an almost compulsive desire for personal recognition. You have a total preoccupation with power and will try to get it at almost any cost. You want to be the world's best at something and that idea spurs you on to all your efforts. You have a powerful magnetism and charisma and people around you either love you and are almost mesmerized by you or they hate you because they feel very threatened by your presence. You will perhaps make a lot of enemies on your climb to the top, just remember that you will reap what you sow, so sow carefully and wisely. Because of your inner power, you have potential for great good or great evil. You want to reform the world and remake it in your own image.

You have organizing and executive ability and you know what it takes to get the job done. You are not interested in the frivolities and fun of life, only what you can accomplish by hard work. Your reserved nature gives people the mistaken impression that you are cold, aloof, unfeeling and uncaring. You have a difficult time showing your softer side because that is not how you were raised. You are fearful of failure and that is why you work so hard so as to avoid it. Depression is a common occurrence for you, but you take it and everything else in stride. You feel alone, that you have to do everything yourself if you want the job done right. But, independence suits you and you do not lash out at your lot in life. It could be a lot worse, you figure. You are ambitious and conscientious to a fault. Your rise in life to a position of authority is a rather slow process, but you work steadily toward it because you are patient and persistent. You tend to be rather stern and judgmental, especially with yourself. Cautious and careful, it is difficult for you to really let go, to be spontaneous and playful. You like to be in control of yourself and you are uncomfortable showing your emotions or your affections. You are shy and self-restrained. To you, life is a serious business. You are a tough disciplinarian and a bit of a wet blanket. You understand rules and regulations and the need for them.

You have the ability to satisfy both your need to be an individual and your need to interrelate with others. You are independent, self-reliant and content with yourself. Your willpower has been used in previous lifetimes to bring your emotions into harmony. This, then, attracts to you general success in life, good home surroundings, faithful friends, esteem in the community, fair financial conditions and generally good health.

*
Sun discordant to Ascendant
You are unusually sociable and you need people around you. You may have an internal conflict as to what to pursue in life.

*
Sun discordant to Jupiter
You tend to be optimistic and confident, but overly so. You are self-indulgent and over-extravagant. There is a selfish streak within you that sometimes keeps you from devoting yourself to others. There may be religious fanaticism here, with a closed-minded adherence to one particular dogma. You do not have the best judgment at times and you promise more than you are capable of delivering. You display false pride. You tend to exaggerate your stories or your own abilities. You find it difficult to generate the necessary resolve to follow through on completing the projects you start. You have big aspirations and the desire to succeed in life in a grand way, but you may not have the initiative or persistence to make it a reality. But in spite of all this, you never seem to lose your hopes for the future.

You may become restless and discontent with the responsibilities and limitations you have in life. At some point your faith will be tested to see just how strong it is. You may encounter legal problems, especially with or through those in positions of authority. You need to ask yourself when does self-confidence become egotism? You want to feel important and that can easily bring on an egotistical manner. You love to show yourself off and make yourself into someone important. You are capable of gaudy displays of extravagance. You are wasteful of the energies and resources that you have been entrusted with. All actions should be carefully thought out, so that you do not experience severe losses due to overspeculation, loans, investments, gambling, etc. Social prestige is important to you. You may be subject to circulation problems of the blood, especially the arterial circulation. Living the "good life" can add extra pounds and this can contribute to health problems as well. You need to stay active and keep exercising.

*
Sun discordant to Mars
You are more concerned with your own self-preservation than with the needs or interests of others. You have a fighting spirit and are in competition with those around you. You need to learn how to cooperate and to compromise. You enjoy picking little fights and going head-to-head with others over almost any matter, no matter how trivial. Your desires get the better of you because you lack self-control. You are selfish at times, you often feel that you need to fight to get what you want, and you tend to have a "me-first" attitude that angers or irritates others. You have a need to be right, even when you aren't. You have difficulty in forgiving others and in saying you are sorry. You have a great deal of energy and vitality but you must be careful that you do not dissipate it in unproductive or sensual living. You are hasty, impatient and sometimes reckless. You have a need to think before you act. You do not like any form of restraint and you rebel against taking orders. You have trouble with superiors because of this and this can affect your career. You have a fiery temper and a tendency towards accidents and fevers. You need to be careful of overexertion as you tend to do things until you simply burn out. You become frustrated easily and you throw fits if you do not get your way. Your impulsive actions can lead you into many difficulties, including perhaps becoming a compulsive gambler. You become frustrated easily and this triggers impatience and anger, which you tend to take out on the ones closest to you.

If you can learn how to properly channel all that drive and energy, then there is no limit to your accomplishments and success. But this will take self-discipline, self-control, restraint, patience, persistence and willpower. You need to realize that your own personal desires may not be in line with your Spirit's desires and that is what is causing all the stress you feel inside. Seek your Higher Self and you can then turn a lot of these negatives into positives. The obstacles that occur concerning the obtaining of your personal desires are to help you remain in agreement with your Spirit's desires. You have the necessary confidence and courage which are of considerable help to you in flowing with the obstacles that this aspect brings into your life. You simply need to develop more self-control.

*
Sun discordant to Moon
Your selfishness and interest in your own affairs keeps you from being sympathetic to the needs and feelings of others. You feel at cross-purposes with yourself because your conscious intentions and desires conflict with your subconscious emotional needs and drives. You feel pulled in two different directions. This is a major reason why you find it hard to be decisive. You vacillate on whether or not you should do this or that and this causes you a great deal of inner stress. You can't seem to make up your mind on anything. You try to do the right thing, but you aren't sure what the right thing is. You have problems with satisfying both your need to be an individual and your need for caring relationships and a sense of belonging. Because of the mixed messages you send out, people don't always know how to respond to you or know what you really want. This can cause confusion and conflict in relationships. You need to find the right balance between your emotions and your will. Come to an awareness that your energy flow fluctuates like the ebb and flow of the tides. When your energy is at a high, you should try to accomplish as much as possible during that time. When your energy is low, then you should pace yourself accordingly and not overtax your physical body. You often fluctuate from being extremely logical to being extremely sensitive. Many times you are unaware of other people's emotional needs and, thus, you fail to respond to them.

*
Sun discordant to Neptune
You have the tendency to dream as a substitute for getting any real work done. You like to procrastinate and put off difficult jobs for as long as possible, hoping they will simply go away. You have a vivid imagination which can get you into trouble because half the stuff you worry about and fret over do not ever happen. You have a need to express yourself creatively through some sort of art form or music, drama or photography, but you may lack the necessary drive, energy, ambition and desire to follow through on your plans. You are attracted to the metaphysical and the occult but there is danger waiting for you if you get involved with negative psychic practices such as Ouija boards, séances, hypnotism or mediums.

You lack willpower and you too easily succumb to temptation. Drugs or alcohol may tempt you and seemingly offer you a way out of your troubles, but if you give in, they will cause you nothing but sorrow. You suffer from delusions of grandeur and you are not very practical. You need to get your head out of the clouds and come back to reality. You are very sympathetic and compassionate and will go out of your way to help someone. But you lack discrimination and are a sucker for any kind of sob story, hence you are often taken advantage of by others. This leaves you depressed and disillusioned. You must remember, though, that no one can hurt you, use you or take advantage of you unless you allow it. You need to develop more backbone and learn how to say "NO".

You may experience personal loss of focus and not know what you should be doing with your life. You are overly emotional, romantic or sentimental. Materialism may blind you to spiritual realities. You are extremely sensitive and need to watch which situations and people you surround yourself with. You have a heightened sensitivity to medicine also, so you need to watch your dosages of any prescribed drugs.

Because you are gentle and peace-loving, you may lack the will and competitive spirit needed to make your way in the world. Your fantasy life brings self-deception or deception by others. You need to become aware that you may have to stand up for your spiritual convictions and principles, even though it may involve conflict. You are easily hurt by what others say about you and many times you take the easy way out by being non-controversial. You need to learn not to idealize others, but to accept them and appreciate them as they are and not as you wish them to be. There may be danger from hidden or secret enemies who have come to you to even the score for wrong-doings in previous lives. Be careful of whom you choose as "friends".

*
Sun discordant to Pluto
You are intensely willful, zealous, and fanatical, though you usually hide the intensity of your feelings and your personal motives and desires. You always want to know what everyone else is up to or thinking, but you will seldom reveal your own motivations, plans and activities. You love working behind the scenes where you are free to do as you please with no one's knowledge or interference. You tend to be possessive, jealous, obsessive and compulsive and you like to have power and control over people and situations. You have the burning desire to be recognized for your expertise and you want more than anything to be recognized as "the authority" at something. You tend to worship "heroes" who have powerful magnetism and charisma, and you want to follow in their footsteps. You need to recognize that your strong will and stubbornness create difficulties for you because you are not allowing others to teach you the lessons you need to learn. In order for you to see this more clearly other people are brought into your life to mirror your negative traits back to you. If you refuse to transform your ego, then things will only get worse, as the universe will get its way with you.

You think you know it all and you believe that you are always right. People are threatened by you and some will try to get you first before you get them. You have a fear of and a fascination with death and the secret, hidden side of life. You are seldom satisfied with your creative talents and are always re-doing or destroying your efforts. You have a knack for controlling others in a very subtle way. You are very confident and have great faith and trust in your own abilities. You believe that you can survive anything that life throws your way. You expect to conquer any obstacle, problem or bad habit that you may have. You have tremendous inner resources, strength and stamina. You find it difficult to respect people who are weak-willed or those who avoid confronting their lives and problems head-on. You have the intuitive perception to see right through things and go straight to the heart of the matter.

Give others a break and stop being such a slave driver. Stay out of their lives and let them run them the way they see fit. Work on reforming yourself before you try to reform the rest of the world. Use power wisely or it will come back to haunt you in the end. Always remember that you will reap everything you sow, so sow wisely and carefully.

*
Sun discordant to Saturn
You tend to be selfish, cold, unfeeling and uncaring, worried, fearful and insecure. You may have a ruthless ambition that lets nothing stand in the way of its goals. You have a cautious, careful, realistic attitude toward life and are highly responsible and disciplined with regard to your obligations and duties. You tend to work and struggle more than you need to, and to take yourself too seriously. You need to lighten up. You prefer the patterns and activities that you are already used to rather than new experiences. You struggle with feelings of personal inadequacy, inhibitions, self-doubt and loneliness. Everything you try to accomplish has to be worked at very hard and perhaps for a very long time. You are subject to delays and frustrations at every turn, it seems. You may have difficulties with your father or those in authority. This is not an easy aspect, but it does give great persistence, endurance, patience and staying power. You need to learn how to give yourself to others with no thought of reward for yourself. Share your love and possessions and open yourself up to the needs and concerns of others. You have been much too selfish and self-absorbed in previous lives and now you must learn to share with others. You are being asked to compromise and cooperate with others in order to remove any tendency towards self-interest.

Another challenge for you is to overcome your self-criticalness. You have a very high standard of what constitutes achievement and perfection and you expect yourself and others to live up to it. But you go overboard with your attitude. First, it is unrealistic. Second, it is impossible to reach. This causes you a great deal of stress and frustration. Then, you feel that others are working against your achieving this perfection, when in reality, it is your Spirit which is attracting inefficiency around you in order to force you to stop judging yourself and others too harshly and critically. Again, the message is for you to lighten up.

*
Sun discordant to Uranus
You are independent, liberal, eccentric, unorthodox and rebellious. This aspect brings pride, selfishness, alienation from others, erratic temperament and lack of self-control and self-discipline. You tend to get involved with too many things which scatters your energies. You jump from one thing to another so quickly that you either never get really good at anything or you never finish anything. People can't count on you because you are erratic and don't follow through on your promises. You are impulsive, restless, nervous and undisciplined. You are subject to accidents because of your rashness, impatience and carelessness. Your life is unstable and full of sudden changes in order to promote soul growth. You may have interest in electronics, astrology, motorcycles or the occult, but don't have the necessary persistence to stick with any of them. You want your freedom at all costs and you crave excitement, adventure, risk and discovery. You have an outrageous nature whereby you simply do things just for the sake of shocking others, perhaps to shake them out of their antiquated attitudes. You want to change and reform everything, even if you don't have a better plan with which to replace the existing situation or condition. People think you are odd and perhaps from another planet. But this bothers you little. In fact, you get a kick out of it. You need to develop an awareness of the needs of others. You have a tendency to think of your own desires first.
