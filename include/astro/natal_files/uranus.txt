Uranus discordant to Neptune
You are a very sensitive individual who might experience trouble if you dabble in any negative psychic practices, such as Ouija boards, séances, hypnotism, crystal-ball gazing, mediums, etc. You can be and probably are influenced a great deal by other people's suggestions, thoughts, words and ideas. You can snatch vibrations and ideas from the ether, as it were, and use them to your benefit if you discipline your mind and emotions. You must not allow your great desire to be different take you away from Truth and wisdom. You will not find your true Self through drugs or alcohol abuse. Service to others will help keep you on the right Path. Keep an open mind and ask your Higher Self to show you the Way. Find emotional and creative release through enterprises such as music, art or writing.

Uranus blending with Pluto
There is power here to help you change outdated social systems and structures should you desire to do so. Whether you use this power for your own selfish purposes or to help uplift humanity is up to you. You can be sure that ruin will follow you if you only use this power for your own gain. Some form of involvement with the masses is indicated. You have much willpower and stamina if you don't get side-tracked with too many different projects. Focus on one thing at a time before moving on to the next. If you are tempted to swerve from the straight and narrow remember that "those who live by the sword die by the sword". Here's another truth to remember — "You will always reap what you sow, so sow carefully and wisely". In some manner, you may make an imprint upon society.

You want to reform what's wrong in the world, but you can do so without being violent, disruptive or rebellious.

Uranus discordant to Pluto
You may have difficulty learning to be independent. You know that it is a good idea to be able to do things for yourself and to be self-reliant, yet at the same time, it is too easy for you to lean on others and have them pull most of your weight. You have too great an emotional need to lean on those you love. The constant and many changes in your life make you feel uneasy and insecure and this is a big reason why you want to rely on others so heavily.
